Binding motifs for the co-repressors and co-activators to PPAR&alpha; have been observed to be conserved, however the co-repressor blocks the AF-2 helix from adopting the active conformation, as demonstrated in x-ray crystallography results presented in Xu et al (2002).  PPAR&alpha; agonists and antagonists have been developed to selectively enhance co-activator or co-repressor binding, respectively (Xu et al 2001, Xu et al 2002).  Regarding the present key event, the prior binding of a PPAR&alpha; antagonists such as GW6471 can stabilize the binding of the co-repressors to the PPAR&alpha; signaling complex suppressing nuclear signaling and thus downstream transcription of PPAR&alpha;-regulated genes.  Additionally, a natural human variant (V227A) in the hinge region of PPAR&alpha; has been demonstrated to stabilize PPAR&alpha;/N-CoR interactions resulting in inhibited transactivation of downstream genes in hepatic cells (Liu et al 2008) which can ultimately lead to measurable phenotypic effects of decreased blood triglycerides (Chan et al 2016).  The Liu et al (2008) study also demonstrated that the transactivation activity in the V227A variant could be restored when N-CoR was silenced.

Wilbanks et al. (2014) and Gust et al (2015) demonstrated inhibition of human PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling in in vitro nuclear signaling bioassays in response to 2,4-dinitrotoluene(2,4-DNT) and 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2A-DNT), respectively.  However, it is unknown if this response was manifested through the co-repressor binding stabilization that was identified in Xu et al (2002)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1002","Inhibition, Deiodinase 2","KE 1002","Disruption of the thyroid hormone system is increasingly being recognized as an important toxicity pathway, as it can cause many adverse outcomes. Thyroid hormones do not only play an important role in the adult individual, but they are also critical during embryonic development. Thyroid hormones (THs) play an important role in a wide range of biological processes in vertebrates including growth, development, reproduction, cardiac function, thermoregulation, response to injury, tissue repair and homeostasis. Numerous chemicals are known to disturb thyroid function, for example by inhibiting thyroperoxidase (TPO) or deiodinase (DIO), upregulating excretion pathways or modifying gene expression. The two major thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), both iodinated derivatives of tyrosine. Most TH actions depend on the binding of T3 to its nuclear receptors. Active and inactive THs are tightly regulated by enzymes called iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO). The activation occurs via outer ring deiodination (ORD), i.e. removing iodine from the outer, phenolic ring of T4 to form T3, while inactivation occurs via inner ring deiodination (IRD), i.e. removing iodine from the inner tyrosol ring of T4 or T3.

Three types of iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1-3) have been described in vertebrates that activate or inactivate THs and are therefore important mediators of TH action. All deiodinases are integral membrane proteins of the thioredoxin superfamily that contain selenocysteine in their catalytic centre. Type I deiodinase is capable to convert T4 into T3, as well as to convert reverse T3 (rT3) to 3,3&#39;-Diiodothyronine (3,3&rsquo; T2), through outer ring deiodination. rT3, rather than T4, is the preferred substrate for DIO1. furthermore, DIO1 has a very high Km (&micro;M range, compared to nM range for DIO2) (Darras and Van Herck, 2012). Type II deiodinase (DIO2) is only capable of ORD activity with T4 as a preferred substrate (i.e., activation of T4 to T3). DIO3 can inner ring deiodinate T4 and T3 to the inactive forms of THs,  rT3 and 3,3&rsquo;-T2 respectively. DIO2 is a transmembrane protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum and the active site faces the perinuclear cytosol. The relative contribution of the DIOs to thyroid hormone levels varies amongst species, developmental stages and tissues."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1003","Decreased, Triiodothyronine (T3)","KE 1003","There are two biologically active thyroid hormones (THs), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and a few less active iodothyronines (rT3, 3,5-T2), which are all derived from the modification of tyrosine molecules (Hulbert, 2000). However, the plasma concentrations of the other iodothyronines are significantly lower than those of T3 and T4. The different iodothyronines are formed by the sequential outer or inner ring monodeiodination of T4 and T3 by the deiodinating enzymes, Dio1, Dio2, and Dio3 (Gereben et al., 2008). Deiodinase structure is considered to be unique, as THs are the only molecules in the body that incorporate iodide.

The circulatory system serves as the major transport and delivery system for THs from synthesis in the gland to delivery to tissues. The majority of THs in the blood are bound to transport proteins (Bartalena and Robbins, 1993). In humans, the major transport proteins are TBG (thyroxine binding globulin), TTR (transthyretin) and albumin. The percent bound to these proteins in adult humans is about 75, 15 and 10 percent, respectively (Schussler 2000). Unbound (free) hormones are approximately 0.03 and 0.3 percent for T4 and T3, respectively. In serum, it is the free form of the hormone that is active.

There are major species differences in the predominant binding proteins and their affinities for THs (see section below on Taxonomic applicability). However, there is broad agreement that changes in concentrations of THs is diagnostic of thyroid disease or chemical-induced disruption of thyroid homeostasis (Zoeller et al., 2007).

It is notable that the changes measured in the free TH concentration reflect mainly the changes in the serum transport proteins rather than changes in the thyroid status. These thyroid-binding proteins serve as hormonal storage which ensures their even and constant distribution in the different tissues, while they protect the most sensitive ones in the case of severe changes in thyroid availability, like in thyroidectomies (Obregon et al., 1981). Initially, it was believed that all of the effects of TH were mediated by the binding of T3 to the thyroid nuclear receptors (TRa and TRb), a notion which is now questionable due to the increasing evidence that support the non-genomic action of TH (Davis et al., 2010, Moeller et al., 2006). Many non-nuclear TH binding sites have been identified to date and they usually lead to rapid cellular response in TH-effects (Bassett et al., 2003). Four types of thyroid hormone signaling have been defined (Anyetei-Anum et al., 2018): type 1 is the canonical pathway in which liganded TR binds directly to DNA; type 2 describes liganded TR tethered to chromatin-associated proteins, but not bound to DNA directly; type 3 suggests that liganded TR can exert its function without recruitment to chromatin in either the nucleus or cytoplasm; and type 4 proposes that thyroid hormone acts at the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm without binding TR, a mechanism of action that is emerging as a key component of thyroid hormone signaling.

The production of THs in the thyroid gland and the circulation levels in the bloodstream are self-controlled by an efficiently regulated feedback mechanism across the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) axis. TH levels are regulated, not only in the plasma level, but also in the individual cell level, to maintain homeostasis. This is succeeded by the efficient regulatory mechanism of the thyroid hormone axis which consists of the following: (1) the hypothalamic secretion of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), (2) the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary, (3) hormonal transport by the plasma binding proteins, (4) cellular uptake mechanisms in the cell level, (5) intracellular control of TH concentration by the deiodinating mechanism (6) transcriptional function of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor and (7) in the fetus, the transplacental passage of T4 and T3 (Cheng et al., 2010).

In regards to the brain, the TH concentration involves also an additional level of regulation, namely the hormonal transport through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) (Williams, 2008). The TRH and the TSH regulate the production of thyroid hormones. Less T3 (the biologically more active TH) than T4 is produced by the thyroid gland. The rest of the required amount of T3 is produced by outer ring deiodination of T4 by the deiodinating enzymes D1 and D2 (Bianco et al., 2006), a process which takes place mainly in liver and kidneys but also in other target organs such as in the brain, the anterior pituitary, brown adipose tissue, thyroid and skeletal muscle (Gereben et al., 2008; Larsen, 2009). Both hormones exert their action in almost all tissues of mammals and they are acting intracellularly, and thus the uptake of T3 and T4 by the target cells is a crucial step of the overall pathway. The trans-membrane transport of TH is performed mainly through transporters that differ depending on the cell type (Hennemann et al., 2001; Friesema et al., 2005; Visser et al., 2008). Many transporter proteins have been identified to date. The monocarboxylate transporters (Mct8, Mct10) and the anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1c1) show the highest degree of affinity towards TH (Jansen et al., 2005) and mutations in these genes have pathophysiological effects in humans (Bernal et al., 2015). Unlike humans with an MCT8 deficiency, MCT8 knockout mice do not have neurological impairment. One explanation for this discrepancy could be differences in expression of the T4 transporter OATP1C1 in the blood&ndash;brain barrier. This shows that cross-species differences in the importance of specific transporters may occur.

T3 and T4 have significant effects on normal development, neural differentiation, growth rate and metabolism (Yen, 2001; Brent, 2012; Williams, 2008), with the most prominent ones to occur during the fetal development and early childhood. The clinical features of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism emphasize the pleiotropic effects of these hormones on many different pathways and target organs. The thyroidal actions though are not only restricted to mammals, as their high significance has been identified also for other vertebrates, with the most well-studied to be the amphibian metamorphosis (Furlow and Neff, 2006). The importance of the thyroid-regulated pathways becomes more apparent in iodine deficient areas of the world, where a higher rate of cretinism and growth retardation has been observed and linked to decreased TH levels (Gilbert et al., 2012). Another very common cause of severe hypothyroidism in human is the congenital hypothyroidism, but the manifestation of these effects is only detectable in the lack of adequate treatment and is mainly related to neurological impairment and growth retardation (Glinoer, 2001), emphasizing the role of TH in neurodevelopment in all above cases. In adults, the thyroid-related effects are mainly linked to metabolic activities, such as deficiencies in oxygen consumption, and in the metabolism of the vitamin, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, but these defects are subtle and reversible (Oetting and Yen, 2007). Blood tests to detect the amount of thyroid hormone (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are routinely done for newborn babies for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism at the earliest stage possible.

Although the components of the thyroid hormone system as well as thyroid hormone synthesis and action are highly conserved across vertebrates, there are some taxon-specific considerations.

Although the HPT axis is highly conserved, there are some differences between fish and mammals (Blanton and Specker, 2007; Deal and Volkoff, 2020). For example, in fish, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) often plays a more important role in regulating thyrotropin (TSH) secretion by the pituitary and thus thyroid hormone synthesis compared to TSH-releasing hormone (TRH). TTRs from fish have low sequence identity with human TTR, for example seabream TTR has 54% sequence identity with human TTR but the only amino acid difference within the thyroxine-binding site is the conservative substitution of Ser117 in human TTR to Thr117 in seabream TTR (Santos and Power, 1999; Yamauchi et al., 1999; Eneqvist et al., 2004). In vitro binding experiments showed that TH system disrupting chemicals bind with equal or weaker affinity to seabream TTR than to the human TTR with polar TH disrupting chemicals, in particular, showing a more than 500-fold lower affinity for seabream TTR compared to human TTR (Zhang et al., 2018).

Zebrafish and fathead minnow are oviparous fish species in which maternal thyroid hormones are transferred to the eggs and regulate early embryonic developmental processes during external (versus intra-uterine in mammals) development (Power et al., 2001; Campinho et al., 2014; Ruuskanen and Hsu, 2018) until embryonic thyroid hormone synthesis is initiated. Maternal transfer of thyroid hormones, both T4 and T3, to the eggs has been demonstrated in zebrafish (Walpita et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2012) and fathead minnows (Crane et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2016).

Several studies have reported evidence of T3 decreases after exposure to TPO inhibitors and deiodinase inhibitors in early life stages of zebrafish (Stinckens et al., 2016; Stinckens et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) and fathead minnow (Nelson et al., 2016; Cavallin et al., 2017)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1046","Suppression, Estrogen receptor (ER) activity","KE 1046","Estrogen receptors are produced in all vertebrates and located in either the cell cytoplasm or nucleus(Bondesson et al., 2015; Eick and Thornton, 2011). Estrogen receptors are localized either in cytoplasm, or on the cell surface.

 

Site of action: Stressors (e.g., clomiphene) act on neuronal cell in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits hypothalamic Estrogen Receptors selectively.

Responses at the macromolecular level: Stressors activate the Estrogen Receptor &alpha; in the presence of lower level of estrogen and partially blocks the same for higher level of estrogen and works as antagonist for the Estrogen Receptor &beta;(Trost and Khera, 2014). Stressors appear to act in the brain&#39;s pituitary gland to secrete an increased amount of gonadotropins hormone (GnRH) in hypothalamus leading towards increased GnRH level in blood. 

Estrogen Receptor &alpha;: ER&alpha; (Estrogen Receptor &alpha; or NR3A1 or ESR1) - A nuclear receptor and it is activated by the estrogen (sex hormone). Estrogen located at chromosome number 6 ( 6q25.1)

Estrogen Receptor &beta;:  ER&beta; (Estrogen Receptor &beta; or NR3A2 or  ESR2) &ndash; This is also nuclear receptor and  activated by the sex hormone estrogen which is located at chromosome number 14 (14q23.2). I ER&beta; has  both N-terminal has DNA binding domain and C-terminal has ligand binding domain. This  is localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) inhibits the ER&beta;. Drugs used as SERM are clomiphene, tamoxifen, raloxifene etc.

Biological compartments:  Estrogen receptors (ER) are present in the plasma membrane. Both ER&alpha; and ER&beta; have diverse functions depending on cells and organs. ERs have also been loacated in cytoplasmic organelles including mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum(Levin, 2009).  

General role in biology: Estrogen receptors (both estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) and estrogen receptor beta (ER&beta;) binds the estrogens to promote the the biological functions of estrogens. Depending upon a balance between ER&alpha; and ER&beta; activities in target organs, estrogen signaling is selectively stimulated or inhibited (Welboren et al., 2009). ER&beta; has a high degree of sequence homology with the classical estrogen receptor. Interestingly, ER&beta; is detected in many tissues, including those previously assumed to be estrogen insensitive. In tissues where both ERs are expressed, such as the hypothalamus, uterus, mammary glands, and immune system, ER&alpha; promotes proliferation whereas ER&beta; has pro-apoptotic and pro-differentiating functions(Morani et al., 2008). ER&alpha; is present mainly in ovary (thecal cells) where as ER&beta; is found mainly in  ovary (granulosa cells)(Paterni et al., 2014). ER&alpha; and ER&beta; is identical approximately 97% in the DNA-binding domain and approximately 56% in the ligand-binding domain(Dahlman-Wright et al., 2006)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/105","Inhibition, Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Complexes","KE 105","The electron transport chain, otherwise known as the respiratory chain, is composed of large protein complexes (CI, CII, CIII, CIV, CV) and two freely mobile electron transfer carriers, ubiquinone and cytochrome c, which are embedded in the inner membrane cristae of the mitochondria (Zhao et al., 2019). Three of these complexes (CI, CIII, CIV; NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase, respectively) act as proton pumps and contribute to the formation of an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which then drives ATP synthesis by complex V (ATP synthase) (Alberts et al., 2014). In eukaryotes, the electron transport chain is the major site of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. Superoxides (O2‑) are generated in low quantities as by-products of oxidative phosphorylation during electron transfer. The O2‑ released into the inter-membrane space (IMS) by CIII can be converted into H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by superoxide dismutase 1 and H2O2 then may diffuse into the cytoplasm (Zhao et al., 2019). Superoxides behave as signalling molecules important in cell proliferation, hypoxia adaption, and cell fate determination but when present in excess or unregulated, induce cell damage and death.

While it is well known that heavy metals target the mitochondria, the exact mechanism of this targeting and inhibition is poorly understood (Belyaeva et al., 2012; Gobe &amp; Crane, 2010). Respiratory complexes CI and CIII are shown to be particularly susceptible to perturbation by heavy metals such as chromium and cadmium (Adiele et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2007). In addition, Uranyl Acetate (UA) induced nephrotoxicity has been linked to the impairment of CII and CIII leading to inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Shaki et al., 2012; Shaki &amp; Pourahmad, 2013). 

Several studies have been conducted in order to understand the exact mechanisms of inhibition by heavy metals. They show that these divalent cations bind to electron transport chain enzyme complexes and modify them, disturbing electron transfer and redox reactions (Blajszczak &amp; Bonini, 2017). For example, rotenone blocks Complex I (Li et al., 2003) and cadmium has the capability to noncompetitively inhibit CIII (Wang et al., 2004). This blocking and inhibition interrupts the transport of electrons through the respiratory chain, specifically resulting in the increase of semiubiquinone formation and subsequently the generation of mitochondrial superoxides (Li et al., 2003). Shaki et al. (2012) have shown, as well, that uranyl acetate (UA) interferes with CII and CIII activity. Function of the electron transport chain can also be suppressed by indirect effects of heavy metals: cisplatin causes oxidative damage of mitochondrial membrane lipids such as cardiolipin, impacting mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). This lipid is responsible for maintaining the inner mitochondrial membrane structure and linking CIII and CIV in a super complex through which protons and electrons move, producing ATP (Santos et al., 2007). Cardiolipin function is therefore vital and its disruption results in inhibition of  mitochondrial integrity and function. 

The inhibition of the electron transport chain initiates a sequence of events in the mitochondria, including: overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS); a reduced ability for oxidative phosphorylation and therefore decreased ATP synthesis; a lowered ATP/ADP ratio; the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial cristae; and the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (Shaki et al., 2012; Adiele et al., 2012). All of these occurrences contribute to overall mitochondrial dysfunction and more adverse outcomes."

This level of impairment of blood vessel morphogenesis best maps to Gene Ontology (GO) annotations: GO:001885 for &lsquo;endothelial cell development&rsquo;, which is defined as &ldquo;The progression of an endothelial cell over time, from its formation to the mature structure&rdquo;; and/or GO:0045601 for &lsquo;regulation of endothelial cell differentiation&rsquo;, defined as &ldquo;Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of endothelial cell differentiation&rdquo;. The numbers of curated genes associated with these categories in the MGI database (http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/gene_ontology/) are 75 genes and 44 genes, respectively, for a total of 97 genes altogether. In addition, pericyte-endothelial interactions are indispensable for maturation and stabilization via broader signaling pathways (eg, VEGFA, PDGFB, Notch-DLL4, AGPNT, Norrin, TGF-&beta;) that have been characterized during patterning neovascularization [Azam et al. 2018; Huang, 2020]. Neovascular stabilization is an active process that requires specific cellular signaling, including pro-angiogenic pathways such as VEGF and FGF, angiopoietin-Tie2 for endothelial cell survival and junction stabilization, PDGF and TGF-&beta; signaling that modify mural cell (pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells) functions to fortify vessel integrity [Murakami, 2012]. Breakdown of these signaling systems results in pathological hyperpermeability and/or genetic vascular abnormalities such as vascular malformations, ultimately progressing to hemorrhage and edema. Vascular mural cells are recruited to the endothelial network by endothelial cell signals [Sinha and Santoro, 2018]. A number of anti-angiogenic compounds, including Vatalanib and Thalidomide, have been shown to impair neovascularization during developmental angiogenesis [Tran et al. 2007; Therapontos et al. 2009; Jang et al. 2009; Rutland et al. 2009; Tal et al. 2014; Vargesson, 2015; Beedie et al. 2016; Ellis-Hutchings et al. 2017; Kotini et al. 2020]. In exposed zebrafish embryos, early effects of potential vascular disrupting chemicals (pVDCs) invoke changes to the anatomical development of intersegmental vessels from the dorsal aorta [Tran et al. 2007; Tal et al. 2014; McCollum et al. 2017]. Thalidomide, for example, has been shown to primarily disrupt immature vascular networks versus more mature vasculature in the embryo [Therapontos et al. 2009; Beedie et al. 2016a, 2016b, 2017]. Evidence for KE:110 in human studies is indirect, based on the association of malformations with altered vascular patterns and exposure to anti-angiogenic drugs in women of reproductive potential or during pregnancy [Husain et al. 2008; van Gelder et al. 2010; Gold et al. 2011; Ligi et al. 2014; Vargesson and Hootnick, 2017]. Key nodes in the ontogenetic regulation of angiogenesis have been investigated with human cell-based high-throughput assay (HTS) platforms in ToxCast to screen for pVDCs acting on the formation, maturation and/or stabilization of endothelial networks [Houck et al. 2009; Knudsen et al. 2011; Kleinstreuer et al. 2014; Saili et al. 2019; Zurlinden et al. 2020]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1101","Altered, Amphibian metamorphosis","KE 1101","Vertebrate metamorphosis is a biological transformation process that transitions an organism from one life stage to another; it is defined by growth of new tissues, programmed death of other tissues and physiological transformation of yet other tissues (Laudet, 2011; Brown and Cai, 2007). In the case of most amphibians, metamorphosis mediates the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life, while in bony and jawless fish, metamorphosis mediates transitions between life stages that offer various advantages for survival and reproduction. In vertebrates, metamorphosis is orchestrated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis involving complex timing of gene expression/repression within various tissues, whereas in some cases across taxonomic classes, metamorphosis has been shown to be controlled very differently by the HPT axis.

Thyroid hormone-mediated amphibian metamorphosis can be characterized by three phases during larval development: (1) pre-metamorphosis, (2) pro-metamorphosis and (3) metamorphic climax. All three of these phases coincide with activity states of the HPT axis. Pre-metamorphosis is characterized by a fully aquatic organism with low-level function of the thyroid gland and very low circulating levels of thyroid hormone. Pro-metamorphosis is characterized by the onset of full thyroid axis function and the initiation of rising levels of thyroid hormone in the plasma, with consequential changes in anatomy and physiology defining the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life. Metamorphic climax occurs when circulating thyroid hormone levels peak, which subsequently decrease to levels maintained homeostatically as adults. This climax period also represents the time at which all anatomical and physiological changes induced by thyroid hormone have either been initiated or are already completed. Detailed descriptions of these processes are reviewed by Brown and Cai (2007).

Altered metamorphosis occurs when these thyroid hormone-mediated processes are perturbed, primarily during pro-metamorphosis and metamorphic climax. These perturbations can lead to either, delayed/arrested development, accelerated development or asynchronous development depending on the xenobiotic mode of action or MIE. Genetic defects or xenobiotic exposure that reduce thyroid hormone synthesis can delay metamorphosis, and in extreme cases, can completely arrest development. The most profound impacts on TH-mediated metamorphosis have be demonstrated through inhibition of key proteins in the TH synthesis pathway including the sodium-iodide symporter (Tietge et al., 2005, 2010; Hornung et al., 2010) and thyroperoxidase (Degitz et al., 2005; Tietge et al., 2010, 2013; Hornung et al., 2010, 2015). Alternatively, agonism of the thyroid axis through inhibition of negative feedback at the level of the hypothalamus-pituitary, or premature activation of thyroid receptor-mediated transcription can accelerate metamorphosis (Degitz et al., 2005), which can lead to asynchronous development due to errors in gene expression timing across the various metamorphic tissues. Asynchronous development can also occur due to inhibition of deiodinase (DIO) enzymes in peripheral tissues. DIO enzymes are responsible for activation and catabolism of TH; when dio gene expression profiles are altered, or the enzymes themselves undergo chemical inhibition, the imbalance of prohormone (T4), active hormone (T3) and inactive hormone (rT3, T2) can cause aberrant tissue development."

(2017) Weight of evidence evaluation of a network of adverse outcome pathways linking activaiton of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in honey bees to colony death. Science of the Total Environment 584-585, 751-775:

&quot;Like most eusocial insects, honey bees exhibit age-based division of
labor and progress from nurse to forager as they age (Seeley, 1982).
This type of age-related behavioral change termed age polyethism, is a
genomically, nutritionally, and hormonally controlled process (Ament
et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2015). Such behavior changes in adult worker
bees occur in a predictable sequence as theymove fromcentrally located
in-hive activities including cleaning brood cells (0&ndash;5 d old), to feeding
brood, capping brood, trimming cappings, and attending the queen
(2&ndash;11 d old), to peripherally located in-hive activities, such as grooming
nest-mates, feeding nest-mates, ventilating the hive, producing wax
and shaping comb cells, receiving and storing nectar, packing pollen,
and processing nectar into honey and pollen into bee bread (11&ndash;20 d
old), to outside activities, including guarding the hive and foraging
(20+ d old) (Seeley, 1982). However, honey bees exhibit phenotypic
plasticity whereby the rate of behavioral change is highly flexible,
meaning that under different scenarios, based on colony needs, bees
will accelerate or reverse their behavioral development. For example,
to compensate for a loss of foragers, disease, or nutritional stress, bees
will initiate precocious (early behavioral development) foraging
(Cheng et al., 2015; Huang and Robinson, 1996). It is biologically plausible
that early initiation of foraging could lead to a shortage of hive bees
needed to tend to the brood, which could hinder development of the
brood. In addition, precocious foraging is correlated with shorter
lifespans. Therefore, bees that forage earlier tend to do so at the expense
of their longevity which could impact overall colony resource acquisition
and productivity (Woyciechowski and Moroń, 2009). However,
the relationship may be complex given that with seasonal variation,
food availability, predation pressures, and adverse weather conditions
that promote greater in-hive activity, older foragers can reverse their
behavior, regenerate hypopharyngeal glands, and assume roles within
the hive (Huang and Robinson, 1996).
Behavioral plasticity is driven, in part, by juvenile hormone (JH) and
its interplay with Vtg, acting together in a feed-back loop to control the
onset of labor tasks, such as foraging (Page et al., 2012). For example,
high Vtg levels suppress JH, delaying onset of foraging behavior,whereas
high JH suppresses Vtg, causing a decrease in nursing behavior (Page
et al., 2012). Studies exploring drivers of precocious foraging, using both
treatment with a JH analog and social manipulation of a single-cohort
colony of 1 d old bees in the absence of older foragers, induced precocious
foraging, demonstrating that both hormonal and social interactions
play a role (Chang et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2015). Active foragers
produce a pheromone, ethyl oleate, which is transferred to the hive
bees during trophallaxis or oral food exchange, delaying the rate at
which bees transition to foraging. Therefore, if the number of foragers
diminishes, recruitment to foraging can be accelerated. Additionally,
allatectomy (removal of the corpora allata glands that produce JH) led
to the discovery that JH is involved in modulating the speed at which
bees develop into foragers, but not in activation of foraging itself
(Sullivan et al., 2003). However, studies using ribonucleic acid

interference (RNAi) to knockdown Vtg production have found the protein
to have a prominent role in the initiation of honey bee foraging,
causing an increase in JH titer and extreme precocious foraging (3 d
old bees) (Guidugli et al., 2005; Marco Antonio et al., 2008).
Vitellogenin is synthesized in fat body cells, released to the hemolymph
(circulation), and taken up in developing oocytes (Corona et al.,
2007). Mature honey bee queens, which lay ~1000 eggs/day, continuously
synthesize Vtg at high levels, including during periods when egg
laying ceases (Seehuus et al., 2006; Corona et al., 2007). However, in
sterile worker bees, Vtg levels have been shown to change throughout
their lives, with the highest levels observed in the long-lived winter
bees and lowest in the short-lived summer foragers (M&uuml;nch et al.,
2015). In addition to the role Vtg plays as an egg yolk protein, it has a
role in oxidative stress resistance (Corona et al., 2007; Seehuus et al.,
2006; Amdam et al., 2004).&quot;"

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are O2- derived molecules that can be both free radicals (e.g. superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, alcoxyl) and non-radicals (hypochlorous acid, ozone and singlet oxygen) (Bedard and Krause 2007; Ozcan and Ogun 2015). ROS production occurs naturally in all kinds of tissues inside various cellular compartments, such as mitochondria and peroxisomes (Drew and Leeuwenburgh 2002; Ozcan and Ogun 2015).

However, in environmental stress situations (exposure to radiation, chemicals, high temperatures) these molecules have its levels drastically increased, and overly interact with macromolecules, namely nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, causing cell and tissue damage (Brieger et al. 2012; Ozcan and Ogun 2015)."

Responses at the macromolecular level: Estrogen receptor antagonists have been shown to interact with the ligand binding domain of ERs.

The occurrence of altered clones of cells in the livers of animals was revealed by enzyme histochemistry with a resulting plethora of different types of clones including those positive for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), placental glutathione transferase and negative for APTase and glucose-6-phosphase (Glauert et al. 1986; Pitot, 1990; Scherer, 1987)

	Mathematical models of clonal formation were developed soon after suffered from non-identifiability of parameters (Moolgavkar &amp; Lubeck 2003; Connolly &amp; Andersen 1991; Cox &amp; Huber 2007). More recently, an examination of a clonal expansion model of cancer suggested a widely accepted model of clonal expansion appeared biologically implausible when compared to a model based on the concept of dysregulated hyperplasia (Bogen 2014). 

	Notwithstanding the vagaries of understanding and modeling early events in cancer pathogenesis, altered hepatic foci representing clones of presumably premalignant cells have been demonstrably observed as a precursor of rodent liver tumors. Oval cells are similar to fetal hepatoblasts and bipotential in that they can differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholantiocytes (Grompe 2013). primary oval cells from rats treated with PPARa activators differentiated into basophilic cells, similar to those in pre-neoplastic basophilic clones observed in chronic studies of PPARa activators (Kaplanski et al. 2000; Marsman &amp; Popp, 1994).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1193","N/A, Breast Cancer","KE 1193","Cancers are thought to arise from a collection of permissive factors which interact within and between different cells of a tissue or tumor to promote tumor growth and invasive characteristics (Sonnenschein and Soto 1999; Hanahan and Weinberg 2011; Floor, Dumont et al. 2012; Goodson, Lowe et al. 2015; Schwarzman, Ackerman et al. 2015; Smith, Guyton et al. 2016; Grashow, De La Rosa et al. 2018). Permissive factors or hallmarks include changes to the cell&rsquo;s dependence on growth signals, proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, senescence, angiogenesis, and invasion and metastasis. These hallmarks are modified by other factors including growth factors, inflammation, oxidative stress, changes to the microenvironment, DNA damage, and changes in gene expression.

The mammary gland is a hormone responsive organ with multiple phases of development from embryogenesis into adulthood. Consequently, certain hallmarks and contributing factors including proliferative response to growth signals, growth factors, changes to the microenvironment, and changes in gene expression play a larger role in this organ, and the importance of various factors shifts depending on developmental stage (Rudel, Fenton et al. 2011). Established risk factors of breast cancer extend beyond genetic contributors (principally alterations in DNA damage response genes) and DNA damaging environmental agents to include exposure to pharmaceutical hormones, timing of puberty and first birth, and lifetime exposure to estrogen and progesterone ((IOM) Institute of Medicine 2012). 

Hormonal and other environmental influences during proliferation and differentiation alter the pace and structure of cellular or mammary gland development to leave tissue in the adult gland more susceptible to cancer. In addition, the elevated hormone concentrations associated with the menstrual cycle and pregnancy provide a regular proliferative stimulus to any pre-cancerous cells present in the breast (Rudel, Fenton et al. 2011). A substantial majority of breast cancers express hormone receptors, and these cancers are particularly responsive to hormones (Badowska-Kozakiewicz, Patera et al. 2015).

Consistent with the importance of growth factors and DNA damage in the development of cancer, driver mutations (mutations that favor the success of the nascent cancer cells and are therefore selected) commonly appear in the growth factor related signaling pathways (BRAF, EGRF, RAS, PI3K, STK11) and in DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint signal pathways (ATM, TP53, CHEK2, CDKN2B (P15), CDK4) (Greenman, Stephens et al. 2007; Croce 2008; Kaufmann, Nevis et al. 2008; Stratton, Campbell et al. 2009; Vandin, Upfal et al. 2012). These and other mutations are acquired over the development of a cancer and contribute to the evolution of the cancer (Wang, Waters et al. 2014; Yates, Gerstung et al. 2015; Begg, Ostrovnaya et al. 2016).

In breast cancer, TP53, PI3K and GATA3 are each mutated in more than 10% of cancers, amplification or mutation of the RB1 pathway are common, and HER2 (an EGFR receptor) is amplified in HER2 type cancers (CGAN 2012). EGFR, HER2, BRAF, RAS, and PI3K participate in the EGFR (growth factor) signaling pathway. Activating mutations in PI3K generate growth factor independent proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, possibly via the RB1 pathway (Gustin, Karakas et al. 2009). GATA is a transcription factor that maintains luminal epithelial cell differentiation and suppresses proliferation, and mutation results in the proliferation of undifferentiated cells (Kouros-Mehr, Slorach et al. 2006; Shahi, Wang et al. 2017).

Environmental factors contribute significantly to the total number of breast cancers. Women exposed to the synthetic hormone DES or the pesticide DDT in utero are up to two to four times more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer in their fifties (Palmer, Wise et al. 2006; Cohn, La Merrill et al. 2015). A study in 2002 found that recipients of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) around menopause are 26% more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer (Narod 2011). When prescriptions of HRT began to fall in response to the study, so did cancer diagnoses. Over the next few years, approximately 5% fewer cancers were diagnosed in women over 45 (Glass, Lacey et al. 2007) with an estimated 126,000 fewer cases of breast cancer over the next ten years (Roth, Etzioni et al. 2014)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1202","Suppression, IL-2 and IL-4 production","KE 1202","Production of T cell cytokines including Interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 is regulated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)/ activator protein-1 (AP-1) complexes. Activated NFAT/AP-1 complex that bind at the site of the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters, thereby induces transcription of IL-2 and IL-4 (Jain et al. 1993).  For IL-2, NFAT proteins are necessary for IL-2 gene expression and cooperation of NFAT with AP-1 is required for IL-2 gene transcription. For IL-4, At least five different NFAT sites have been described in the IL-4 promoter with at least three of them being composite sites binding NFAT and AP-1 (Maci&aacute;n et al. 2001).

IL-2 binds to IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and acts on T cells. CD25 is one of IL-2R. Basiliximab (Simulect) is known as anti-CD25 antibody. Basiliximab binds to IL-2R and blocks IL-2 signaling. Clinical transplantation study of basiliximab reveals decreases in rejections. On the other hand, basiliximab inhibits the activation of antigen specific T cells (Novartis Pharma 2016). 

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) hinder the formation of the functional NFAT/AP-1 complexes by interfering with NFAT nuclear localization (Flanagan et al. 1991).  Reduced binding of NFAT/AP-1 complexes at the promoter site of the IL-2 gene lowers the transcription of the mRNA of IL-2 and the following cytokine production.

Transcription of IL-4 is also inhibited by CNIs in the same manner as IL-2 (Dumont et al. 1998).

 

In CD3/ phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-activated human T cells, FK506 suppressed production of IL-2, IL-4, and Interferon (IFN)-&gamma; at the concentrations of 1.2 to 12.5 nM after 22 to 24 hours culture as well as inhibited expression of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-&gamma; mRNA at 10 nM (Dumont et al. 1998).

Treatment with CsA completely eliminated detectable IL-2 release from 3A9 T cells co-cultured with antigen-bearing Ch27 B cells with an IC25 and IC50 for IL-2 production of 1.19 nM and 1.99 nM. Treatment with other immunosuppressant compounds (dexamethasone, azathioprine, methotrexate, benzo(a)pyrene and urethane) also resulted in decreased IL-2 release from stimulated 3A9 T cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Urethane, a weakly immunosuppressive chemical, was least potent in the assay, with an IC25 and IC50 for IL-2 secretion of 4.24 mM and 13.26 mM (D.M. Lehmann. et al. 2018).

In male CD-1 mice, chronic psychosocial stress (types of social outcome occurred: residents becoming subordinates) reduced IL-2 release in response to keyhole limpet hemocyanine (KLH) (Alessandro, B. et al. 2003).

In female B6C3F1 mice, 1,2:5,6-dibenzanthracene exposure reduced production of IL-2 in spleen cell culture supernatants after in vitro stimulation with Concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide (Donna, C. et al. 2010).

Treatment with CsA at 50 mg/kg BID via oral gavage or 2C1.1 (a fully human anti-ORAI1 monoclonal antibody) at 25 mg/kg single IV resulted in reduction of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-17 cytokine production from PMA/ionomycin stimulation of whole blood in the cynomolgus monkey (Kevin, G. et al. 2014).

CNIs is considered to increase carcinogenicity through the suppression of IL-2 and IL-4 production.


	Renal transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy were found to develop cancer within 10 years after surgery (Luster, M.I. et al. 1993).


In experimental animal studies, carcinogenicity of FK506 was reported as follows.


	In mice subjected to topical application testing, in which 100 &mu;L of FK506 ointment was applied once daily for two years to roughly 40% of the total body area, an increased incidence of lymphoma was found in mice of the 0.1% ointment group showing high blood concentrations of the drug (Maruho Co., Ltd 2014).
	In hairless albino mice, virtually all of which developed skin tumors after a 40-week exposure to ultraviolet light, application of a 1% FK506 ointment reduced the time to outbreak of the skin tumors. (Maruho Co., Ltd 2014)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1214","Altered gene expression specific to CAR activation, Hepatocytes","KE 1214","This key event describes the gene expression changes specific to activation of the constitutive androstane receptor transcription factor (CAR; NR1I3) in the hepatocytes of mammalian species that have been have been exposed to xenobiotics or endogenous activators. Changes in mRNA concentrations, protein concentrations, or protein activity may be used to measure CAR-dependent gene regulation.

CAR is maintained in a multiprotein complex in the cytoplasm in its inactive state. CAR may be activated by direct binding of a ligand (e.g. TCPOBOP) or by indirect mechanisms that do not involve ligand-CAR interactions (e.g., activation by phenobarbital). Activated CAR is released from the protein complex in the cytoplasm and is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds as a dimer with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR&alpha;) to regulatory DNA elements of target genes. CAR-RXR binding to specific target genes is achieved via a highly conserved DNA-binding domain on the CAR molecule, and results in the stimulation or suppression of target gene transcription (Omiecinski et al., 2011b;  Tolson and Wang, 2010).

CAR is primarily expressed in the liver and small intestine and is activated by a variety of xenobiotics and by endobiotics such as bilirubin. CAR-dependent expression profiles identified in the livers of all mammalian species include genes involved in phase I and phase II xenobiotic metabolism and transport, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism (Omiecinski et al., 2011a;  Tolson and Wang, 2010). In rats and mice, but not other mammalian species, additional CAR-responsive genes that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis have been identified (Peffer et al., 2018b). Some xenobiotics will induce several transcription factors simultaneously, and these transcription factors may regulate the expression of some of the same genes. For instance, there is some overlap between the gene expression profiles of CAR-responsive genes and pregnane X receptor (PXR)-responsive genes. Both PXR and CAR can dimerize with RXR&alpha; and have been shown to influence the expression of common genes involved in functions such as xenobiotic metabolism, apoptosis, and cell signaling, although each transcription factor also independently controls the expression of genes specific to that nuclear receptor as well (Cui and Klaassen, 2016;  Tojima et al., 2012;  Tolson and Wang, 2010).

Hepatic CAR-dependent genes have been identified by comparing the transcriptional profiles of wild-type mice to those of CAR-null mice after xenobiotic stimulation. These include genes involved in functions such as apoptosis, lipid metabolism, xenobiotic metabolism and transport, cholesterol biosynthesis, and cell cycle regulation (Aleksunes and Klaassen, 2012;  Tojima et al., 2012).

The induced expression of several genes have been used as indicators of hepatic CAR activation in mice and rats, but not all of these genes are specific to CAR activation. In particular, CAR activation leads to the induction of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes belonging to the cytochrome P450 CYP2B and CYP3A subfamilies, namely the increased expression of Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a11 in mice, Cyp2b1/2 and Cyp3a1 in rats, and CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in humans (Cui and Klaassen, 2016;  Deguchi et al., 2009;  Geter et al., 2014;  Oshida et al., 2015a;  Peffer et al., 2018b). Cross-talk can occur between xenobiotics, and PXR activation can also induce CYP2B and CYP3A isoforms; however, unlike prototypical CAR activators, PXR activators will generally induce expression of CYP3A isoforms to a greater extent than CYP2B isoforms. Other metabolizing and transporter genes that are upregulated by CAR activation include UGT1A1, MRP2, SLC1A6, GSTA1 and GSTA2, and sulfotransferase enzymes have been found to be activated or suppressed by CAR activation with extensive variations based upon the species and sex of the animals (Tolson and Wang, 2010). This induction may be assayed at the mRNA level or the enzyme activity level (Elcombe et al., 2014;  Felter et al., 2018;  Peffer et al., 2018b). The induction of Ki67 and Gadd45b, genes that are implicated in cell proliferation, have also been used as indicators of CAR activation in mice and rats, although the expression of these genes is not strictly CAR-dependent (Columbano et al., 2005;  Peffer et al., 2018a;  Peffer et al., 2018b). Gadd45b can play an anti-apoptotic role, and its induction coincides with entry into an active cell cycle. It has been classified as a marker of immediate early phase of hepatocyte cell proliferation (Columbano et al., 2005). Ki67 is one of several cell cycle control genes that are transcriptionally altered in response to CAR activation to ultimately result in a pro-proliferative, anti-apoptotic environment (Peffer et al., 2018b).

A gene expression biomarker signature of CAR activation has been developed based on the genomic responses of livers of wild-type and CAR-null mice after exposure to three structurally-diverse CAR activators, namely phenobarbital, TCPOBOP, or CITCO, for three days. This resulted in a gene expression signature containing 83 genes (76 upregulated, 7 downregulated) that can be used to reliably predict CAR activation  in the mouse liver using a Running Fisher&rsquo;s algorithm (Oshida et al., 2015a). This signature was shown to exhibit a prediction accuracy of 97% when tested against chemicals that are known to be positive and negative for CAR activation in the mouse."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1250","Decrease, Lung function","KE 1250","Lung function is a clinical term referring to the physiological functioning of the lungs, most often in association with the tests used to assess it. Lung function loss can be caused by acute or chronic exposure to airborne toxicants or by an intrinsic disease of the respiratory system.  

Although signs of cellular injury are typically exhibited first in the nose and larynx, alveolar-capillary barrier breakdown may ultimately arise and result in local edema (Miller and Chang, 2003). Clinically, bronchoconstriction and hypoxia are seen in the acute phase, with affected subjects exhibiting shortness of breath (dyspnea) and low blood oxygen saturation, and with reduced lung function indices of airflow, lung volume and gas exchange (Hert and Albert, 1994; and How it is Measured or Detected;). When alveolar damage is extensive, the reduced lung function can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This severe compromise of lung function is reflected by decreased gas exchange indices (PaO2/FIO2 &le;200 mmHg, due to hypoxemia and impaired excretion of carbon dioxide), increased pulmonary dead space and decreased respiratory compliance (Matthay et al., 2019). Acute inhalation exposures to chemical irritants such as ammonia, hydrogen chloride, nitrogen oxides and ozone typically cause local edema that manifests as dyspnea and hypoxia. In cases where a breakdown of the alveolar capillary function ensues, ARDS develops. ARDS has a particularly high risk of mortality, estimated to be 30-40% (Gorguner and Akgun, 2010; Matthay et al., 2018; Reilly et al., 2019).

Lung function decrease due to reduction in lung volume is seen in pulmonary fibrosis, which can be linked to chronic exposures to e.g. silica, asbestos, metals, agricultural and animal dusts (Meltzer and Noble, 2008; Cheresh et al., 2013; Cosgrove, 2015; Trethewey and Walters, 2018). Additionally. decreased lung function occurs in pleural disease, chest wall and neuromuscular disorders, because of obesity and following pneumectomy (Moore, 2012). Decreased lung function can also be a result of narrowing of the airways by inflammation and mucus plugging resulting in airflow limitation. Decreased lung function is a feature of obstructive pulmonary diseases (e.g. asthma, COPD) and linked to a multitude of causes, including chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, dust, metals, organic solvents, asbestos, pathogens or genetic factors."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1252","Binding to (interferes with) topoisomerase II enzyme","KE 1252","Type II topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that are required for proper chromosome structure and segregation and play important roles in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Type II topoisomerases change DNA topology by breaking and rejoining double-stranded DNA. These enzymes can introduce or remove supercoils and can separate two DNA duplexes that are intertwined. Type II topoisomerases relax DNA and remove knots and tangles from the genetic material by passing an intact double helix (transport segment) through a transient double-stranded break that they generate in a separate DNA segment (gate segment). Humans encode two closely related isoforms of the type II enzyme. Topoisomerase II &THORN; is essential for the survival of proliferating cells and topoisomerase II &szlig; plays critical roles during development. However, because these enzymes generate double-stranded DNA breaks during their crucial catalytic functions, the consequences are not only beneficial. Although essential to cell survival, they also pose an intrinsic threat to genomic integrity every time they act. Beyond their critical physiological functions, topoisomerase II&THORN; and II&szlig; are the primary targets for some of the most active and widely prescribed drugs currently used for the treatment of human cancers. These agents kill cells by increasing levels of covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes that are normal, but fleeting, intermediates in the catalytic DNA strand passage reaction. Many chemicals do so by inhibiting the ability of the type II enzymes to ligate cleaved DNAs. When the resulting enzyme-associated DNA breaks are present in sufficient concentrations, they can trigger cell death pathways. Chemicals that target type II enzymes are referred to as topoisomerase II poisons because they convert these indispensable enzymes to potent physiological toxins that generate DNA damage in treated cells. Because the enzyme functions by passing an intact double helix through a transient double-stranded break, any disturbances in its function, e.g. by chemical inhibitors, could have a profound effect on genomic stability, resulting in DNA repair response, gene and chromosomal damage, initiation of apoptosis and ultimate cell death. A double-strand break and error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair mechanism may lead to gene rearrangements; chromosomal translocations and consequently fusion genes (see Figure 33). A comprehensive description of TopoII enzymes and their functions and derangements could be found in recent review articles (Cowell and Austin 2012; Pendleton et al 2014; Ketron and Osheroff 2014).

The above description of the MIE is of significance because there are 3 different kinds of &ldquo;poisons&quot; of TopoII enzyme, out of which competitive inhibitors prevent the function of the enzyme and cause cell death, whereas other interfacial and covalent inhibitors may cause &ndash; depending on the situation &ndash; other consequences of DNA damage response including chromosomal rearrangements (Pendleton et L 2014; Lu et al 2015). A further prerequisite for the specific outcome, i.e. creation of chromosomal rearrangement, is that TopoII &ldquo;poison&rdquo; has to occur in an especially vulnerable and correct hot spot in the MLL locus in the right target cell vulnerable to transformation.

The MIE, topo II poisons, can occur prenatally i.e. prenatal exposure to topo II poisons. Human embryonic stem cells are more sensitive to topo II inhibition than postnatal CD34+ cells, linking embryonic exposure to topoisomerase II poisons to genomic instability. However, little is know about the nature of the target cell for transformation (Bueno et al. 2011)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1253","MLL chromosomal translocation","KE 1253","Chromosomal rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene, located on the q23 band of chromosome 11 (11q23), are the genetic hallmark of most infant leukaemias (Meyer et al 2013; Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). MLL is located within the fragile site FRA11G; chromosomal fragile sites are regions of the genome susceptible to breakage under conditions of replication stress; interference with TopoII may promote fragile site instability. MLL encodes a protein homologous to the Drosophila trithorax gene, which has relevant functions in embryogenesis and hematopoiesis (Ernest et al 2004, Hess et al 1997).

MLL, a human homologue of the epigenetic transcriptional regulator Trithorax of Drosophila, is an upstream transcriptional effector of HOX genes. The importance of normal MLL protein for normal axial-skeletal developmental process and HOX gene regulation has been demonstrated in the embryos of heterozygous and homozygous MLL knockout and MLL truncation mutant mice. Furthermore, expression of MLL protein is not necessary for turning on transcription of certain HOX genes, but for the maintenance of their transcription. Experiments in vitro using hematopoietic progenitors from embryos of homozygous MLL knockout mice or mice with MLL mutant showed that MLL was also critical for hematopoietic development. Recent findings suggested that MLL is required during embryogenesis for the specification or expansion of hematopoietic stem cells.  As HOX genes also play a key role in the regulation of hematopoietic development, the hematopoietic dysfunction of MLL null cells is likely to be attributed to deregulated patterns of HOX gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors. This link between MLL, HOX gene regulation, and hematopoiesis is of particular importance (Li et al. 2005).

There are many translocation and fusion partners for MLL; DNA breakage within MLL can lead to rearrangement with over 120 partner genes (Meyer et al 2013). 

MLL protein (complexed with a large number of other protein factors) serves as a transcriptional activator or repressor via the binding to promoter regions of active genes, marking these regions by covalent histone modifications (Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). Translocation and creation of fusion genes and products destroys the intrinsic control mechanisms of the MLL protein. The resulting &lsquo;ectopic&rsquo; functions involve promoter hyper-activation and re-acquiring stem cell features (Sanjuan-Pla et al 2015). A schematic presentation of the drastic changes of the MLL product is depicted in the figure below.

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1254","Infant leukaemia","KE 1254","B cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) is the most frequent cancer in children. Infant leukaemia is a rare haematological disease with an incidence of 1 in 106 newborns, accounting for 10% of all B cell-ALLs in children younger than 15 years, manifesting soon after birth (&lt;1 year) and displaying an intermediate prognosis except for some cytogenetic subgroups such as MLL -rearranged (MLL-r) B cell-ALL, which remains an outlier high-risk group having a poor prognosis (Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2015). Compared with the more frequent childhood leukaemias, infant leukaemia shows distinct features:

- An early neonatal manifestation suggests an in utero initiation as an &lsquo;intrauterine developmental disease&rsquo; (Greaves, 2015; Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2015);

- Rearrangements of the MLL gene on the q23 band of chromosome 11 as the hallmark genetic abnormality (Joannides and Grimwade, 2010).

- However, MLL is not the only translocation gene. Whereas about 60&ndash;80% of infant ALL carry an MLL(Sam et al., 2012; Jansen et al., 2007), for infant acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) the percentage of MLL is lower than 40%;

- The MLL-r occurs at an early stage of development, with the target cells (still unidentified) being likely theHSPCs in foetal liver and/or pre-haematopoietic mesodermal foetal precursors (Bueno et al., 2009; Menendez et al., 2009);

- Infant MLL-r leukaemia has the least number of somatic mutations among all the sequenced cancers (1.3 vs 6.5/case; Andersson et al., 2015; Dobbins et al., 2013), pointing to the lack of a &ldquo;second hit&rdquo; assumed in the classic carcinogenesis paradigm.

 

The overall scientific evidence, including the stable genome of patients, suggests that infant leukaemia originates from one &ldquo;big-hit&rdquo; occurring during a critical developmental window of HSPC vulnerability (Andersson et al., 2013; Greaves, 2015). In contrast to the &ldquo;two-hit&rdquo; model of the adult and childhood leukaemias, infant leukaemia is a developmental disorder where the differentiation arrest and clonal expansion are a direct consequence of in utero MLL translocation in target HSPCs. Even if MLL is not present in 100% of infant leukaemias, the &lsquo;MLL rearranged (MLL-r) infant leukaemia&rsquo;, especially MLL-r B-ALL, is taken here as a model for the disease principally because of the quantity of scientific evidence.

Clinically,IFL is characterised by symptoms of leukaemia &ndash; thrombocytopenia resulting in sensitivity to bruising and bleeding, anaemia with pallor and fatigue, neutropenia associated with increased susceptibility to infections &ndash; are principally due to the displacement of the normal haematopoiesis by expansion of leukaemia cells. Leukemic infiltration of the brain is common at diagnosis of the infant leukaemia (Hunger and Mulligham, 2015)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1262","Apoptosis","KE 1262","Apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, is characterized by distinct morphology with DNA fragmentation and energy dependency [Elmore, 2007]. Apoptosis, also called &ldquo;physiological cell death&rdquo;, is involved in cell turnover, physiological involution, and atrophy of various tissues and organs [Kerr et al., 1972]. The formation of apoptotic bodies involves marked condensation of both nucleus and cytoplasm, nuclear fragmentation, and separation of protuberances [Kerr et al., 1972]. Apoptosis is characterized by DNA ladder and chromatin condensation. Several stimuli such as hypoxia, nucleotides deprivation, chemotherapeutical drugs, DNA damage, and mitotic spindle damage induce p53 activation, leading to p21 activation and cell cycle arrest [Pucci et al., 2000]. The SAHA or TSA treatment on neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) for 24 or 72 hrs inhibited proliferation of the NHDF cells [Glaser et al., 2003]. Considering that the acetylation of histone H4 was increased by the treatment of SAHA for 4 hrs, histone deacetylase inhibition may be involved in the inhibition of the cell proliferation [Glaser et al., 2003]. The impaired proliferation was observed in HDAC1-/- ES cells, which was rescued with the reintroduction of HDAC1 [Zupkovitz et al., 2010]. An AOP focuses existes on p21 pathway leading to apoptosis, however, alternative pathways such as NF-kappaB signaling pathways may be involved in the apoptosis of spermatocytes [Wang et al., 2017].

Apoptosis is defined as a programmed cell death.  A decrease in apoptosis or a resistance to cell death is noted is described as a hallmark of cancer by Hanahan et al. It is widely admitted as an essential step in tumor proliferation (Adams, Lowe).  Apoptosis occurs after activation of a number of intrinsic and extrinsic signals which activate the protease caspase system which in turn activates the destruction of the cell. 

The Bcl-2 is a protein family suppressing apoptosis by binding and inhibiting two proapoptotic proteins (Bax and Bak) and transferring them to the mitochondrial outer membrane. In the absence of inhibition by Bcl2, Bax and Bak destroy the mitochondrial membrane and releases proapoptotic signaling proteins, such as cytochrome c which activated the caspase system. An increased expression of these antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) occurs in cancer (Hanahan, Adams, Lowe). Several others pathways such as the loss of TP53 tumor suppressor function, or the increase of survival signals (Igf1/2), or decrease of proapoptotic factors (Bax, Bim, Puma) can also increase tumor growth (Hanahan, Juntilla).

In breast cancer a decrease in apoptosis and a resistance to cell death has been described thoroughly, especially using a dysregulation of the Bcl2 system or TP53 (Parton, Williams, Shahbandi)."

Interestingly, although calcium may often promote neuronal death, it can also activate pathways that promote survival. For example, calcium can promote survival through a pathway involving activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (Yano et al., 1998). Calcium is a prominent regulator of cellular responses to stress, activating transcription through the cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which can promote neuron survival in experimental models of developmental cell death (Hu et al., 1999). Calcium can also activate a rapid neuroprotective signalling pathway in which the calcium-activated actin-severing protein gelsolin induces actin depolymerization, resulting in suppression of calcium influx through membrane NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels (Furukawa et al., 1997). This may occur through intermediary actin-binding proteins that interact with NMDA receptor and calcium channel proteins. Finally, signals such as calcium and secreted amyloid precursor protein-&alpha; (sAPP-&alpha;), which increase cyclic GMP production, can induce activation of potassium channels and the transcription factor NF-&kappa;B, and thereby increase resistance of neurons to excitotoxic apoptosis (Furukawa et al., 1996)."

Once released, it can bind D1-like or D2-like G protein receptor which have different effects (Stoof and Kebabia, 1984; Vallender et al., 2010).

It is conserved among vertabrates and regulates neural activity, behavior and gene expression. The main impacts are related to voluntary movement, feeding, and reward.

Although it is also expressed in other tissues (http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYP2E1), the body of literature on CYP2E1 is focussed on measurement in liver. CYP2E1 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, but can also be present in the mitochondria.  It is a phase I metabolism enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of low molecular weight substrates. Unlike most cytochrome P450 enzymes, Cyp2E1 is constitutively expressed (i.e., its expression is not transcriptionally controlled by substrate-bound nuclear receptors). Alternatively, exposure to a substrate increases its activity through post-translational stabilization of the molecule. Thus, the presence of substrate significantly increases the half-life of the Cyp2E1 enzyme thereby allowing it to be active for a longer period of time (Gonzalez 2007, Song, et al. 1989). The sustained activation of Cyp2E1 due to the presence of the chemical substrate is required for this MIE to produce downstream adverse effects. 

Cyp2E1 is also regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the involvement of hsp-based chaperone (Morishima et al. 2005); however, this mechanism of regulation is not discussed further herein."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1392","Oxidative Stress","KE 1392","Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses. High levels of oxidizing free radicals can be very damaging to cells and molecules within the cell.  As a result, the cell has important defense mechanisms to protect itself from ROS. For example, Nrf2 is a transcription factor and master regulator of the oxidative stress response. During periods of oxidative stress, Nrf2-dependent changes in gene expression are important in regaining cellular homeostasis (Nguyen, et al., 2009) and can be used as indicators of the presence of oxidative stress in the cell. 

In addition to the directly damaging actions of ROS, cellular oxidative stress also changes cellular activities on a molecular level. Redox sensitive proteins have altered physiology in the presence and absence of ROS, which is caused by the oxidation of sulfhydryls to disulfides on neighboring amino acids (Antelmann &amp; Helmann 2011). Importantly Keap1, the negative regulator of Nrf2, is regulated in this manner (Itoh, et al. 2010). 

ROS also undermine the mitochondrial defense system from oxidative damage. The antioxidant systems consist of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, as well as antioxidants such as &alpha;-tocopherol and ubiquinol, or antioxidant vitamins and minerals including vitamin E, C, carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium, and zinc (Fletcher, 2010). The enzymes, vitamins and minerals catalyze the conversion of ROS to non-toxic molecules such as water and O2. However, these antioxidant systems are not perfect and endogenous metabolic processes and/or exogenous oxidative influences can trigger cumulative oxidative injuries to the mitochondria, causing a decline in their functionality and efficiency, which further promotes cellular oxidative stress (Balasubramanian, 2000; Ganea &amp; Harding, 2006; Guo et al., 2013; Karimi et al., 2017).  

However, an emerging viewpoint suggests that ROS-induced modifications may not be as detrimental as previously thought, but rather contribute to signaling processes (Foyer et al., 2017). 

 

Sources of ROS Production 

Direct Sources: Direct sources involve the deposition of energy onto water molecules, breaking them into active radical species. When ionizing radiation hits water, it breaks it into hydrogen (H*) and hydroxyl (OH*) radicals by destroying its bonds. The hydrogen will create hydroxyperoxyl free radicals (HO2*) if oxygen is available, which can then react with another of itself to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and more O2 (Elgazzar and Kazem, 2015). Antioxidant mechanisms are also affected by radiation, with catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) levels rising as a result of exposure (Seen et al. 2018; Ahmad et al. 2021).  

Indirect Sources: An indirect source of ROS is the mitochondria, which is one of the primary producers in eukaryotic cells (Powers et al., 2008).  As much as 2% of the electrons that should be going through the electron transport chain in the mitochondria escape, allowing them an opportunity to interact with surrounding structures. Electron-oxygen reactions result in free radical production, including the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Zhao et al., 2019). The electron transport chain, which also creates ROS, is activated by free adenosine diphosphate (ADP), O2, and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Hargreaves et al. 2020; Raimondi et al. 2020; Vargas-Mendoza et al. 2021). The first and third complexes of the transport chain are the most relevant to mammalian ROS production (Raimondi et al., 2020). The mitochondria has its own set of DNA and it is a prime target of oxidative damage (Guo et al., 2013). ROS is also produced through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (Nox) stimulation, an event commenced by angiotensin II, a product/effector of the renin-angiotensin system (Nguyen Dinh Cat et al. 2013; Forrester et al. 2018). Other ROS producers include xanthine oxidase, immune cells (macrophage, neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), monoamine oxidase (MAO), and carbon-based nanomaterials (Powers et al. 2008; Jacobsen et al. 2008; Vargas-Mendoza et al. 2021)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1393","Hepatocytotoxicity","KE 1393","Taxonomic Applicability: Hepatotoxicity can occur in any species that has a liver.

Sex applicability: It can occur in both sexes

How it works: Hepatotoxicity occurs through three main mechanisms: apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis. (1) During programmed cell death, apoptotic cells are &lsquo;disassembled&rsquo; and cellular components &lsquo;bleb&rsquo; off as large vacuoles, which can be eliminated by phagocytosis. Apoptosis is activated via the extrinsic pathway (mediated through a death receptor, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor; TNFR) or intrinsic pathway (mediated through the mitochondria), each of which activate the caspase cascade (Riedl and Shi 2004). (2) Necrosis is an unregulated, accidental form of cell death that occurs when severe damage to cellular components causes the cell to die abruptly and spill its contents into the extracellular space.  Released cellular components include damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that trigger an inflammatory response. (3) The third type of cell death is necroptosis, or programmed necrosis, which uses the same death receptor that is upstream to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, but signaling results in a necrotic outcome. The decision for TNFR to signal for apoptosis or necroptosis is thought to depend on the receptor protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIP1, RIP3), which are part of the protein complex that forms on the intra-cellular portion of the TNFR. Activation of caspase-8 cleaves the RIP1-RIP3 complex and favours apoptosis, whereas inhibition of caspase-8 favours the RIP1-RIP3 complex (called the &lsquo;necrosome&rsquo;). As per standard necrosis, necroptosis results in DAMP release, which triggers inflammation. Necroptosis has been reviewed (Vandenabeele, et al. 2010). Cell death mechanisms in the liver and in liver disease have also been reviewed (Eguchi, et al. 2014, Luedde, et al. 2014).

The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is an important process that leads to necrosis or apoptosis. When the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is triggered (ASK1MKK4JNK), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)  is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Youle and Strasser 2008). Bax triggers the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP), through which cytochrome c is released, which triggers the caspase cascade and apoptosis. Alternatively, when the MTP opens across the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, mitochondrial swelling and decoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., loss of ATP generation) leads to cell death by necrosis (Pessayre, et al. 2010, Rasola and Bernardi 2007)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1394","Induction, persistent proliferation/sustained proliferation","KE 1394","Cellular proliferation rates increase in response to cell death in the liver in order to replace the dying cells. Cellular proliferation refers to the production of new cells to maintain a balance of cell division and cell loss. This key event describes conditions under which this process is persistent or sustained because of chronic exposure. This process is analogous to liver regenerative proliferation (e.g., regerating liver cells following partial hepatectomy), which is often used as a model. 

The liver has two modes of regenerating lost cells: (1) via cellular hypertrophy and division of existing cells; or (2) via proliferation of a population of facultative stem cells, called biliary epithelial cells (BECs), located at the Canals of Hering (in zone 1 where canaliculi join and drain into the main bile duct). Facultative stem cells are functional, differentiated cells that will dedifferentiate in response to tissue damage, thereby becoming a population of progenitor cells that can redifferentiate to replace multiple lost cell types.In a process known as ductal expansion, BECs dedifferentiate into oval cells, which then redifferentiate into hepatocytes or BECs in order to regenerate damaged liver tissue. Liver regeneration has been reviewed (Mao, et al. 2014, Stanger 2015, Yanger and Stanger 2011).

At the molecular level, two dimeric transcription factors, AP-1 (particularly the c-Jun monomer) and NF-kappaB, are key players during liver cellular proliferation and regeneration. While neither is expressed in normal liver tissue, they are upregulated during normal hepatic regeneration, and are required for regeneration (Alcorn, et al. 1990, Cressman, et al. 1994, FitzGerald, et al. 1995). Indeed, rodents lacking AP-1 or NF-kappaB display impaired liver regeneration, often leading to death (Behrens, et al. 2002, Schrum, et al. 2000). Both NF-kappaB and c-Jun (AP-1) are required for embryonic liver development, and a loss of either one is embryonic lethal due to widespread cell death and liver degeneration (Behrens, et al. 2002, Eferl, et al. 1999, Jochum, et al. 2001, Li, et al. 1999, Rudolph, et al. 2000).

A causal network for sustained proliferation and regenerative proliferation in liver can also occur via WNT signaling and the following pathways: the network begins with oxidative stress or other mechanisms causing liver tissue injury which in turn causes (2) activation of macrophages and wound repair (Boulter et al., 2012), (3) increased hypoxia through diminished blood supply or activity of reactive oxygen species (Ju et al., 2016, Gonzalez et al., 2018) and (4) increased expression of Wnt ligands (Okabe et al., 2016). The activation of macrophages causes (5) activation of Wnt proteins and Wnt signaling (Boulter et al., 2012, Vanella and Wynn 2017). The activation and/or increased expression of Wnt signaling ligands causes (6) binding of the Wnt ligand to the co-receptors Frizzled (FZD family) and (7) Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) which then (8) recruit and phosphorylate Dishevelled (DVL1) and the scaffold protein Axin (Takigawa and Brown 2008).

The phosphorylation and recruitment of Axin (AXIN1, AXIN2), (33) inhibits formation of the beta-catenin destruction complex, composed of AXIN1 or AXIN2, adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which (10) targets beta-catenin for degradation. Inhibiting formation of the destruction complex increases the amount of available beta-catenin to (11) interact and complex with the transcription factor 7 and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors (TF7, TCF7L1, TCF7L2, LEF1; Takigawa and Brown 2008).  The TCF/LEF:beta-catenin complex then (12) activates transcription of MYC proto-oncogene (MYC) and (13) cyclin D1 or CCND1 (Schuijers et al 2014;Katoh 2017). Activation of Wnt signaling (14) inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation activity which then (15) represses forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) activity, (34) causes increased turnover of CCND1 and (35) increases proteolysis of MYC (Katoh 2017; Gregory et al., 2003).

FOXM1 activates (16) transcription of MYC and (17) transcription of MAPK8, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (also known as JNK1; Wierstra and Alves 2007; Wang et al., 2008). Transcriptional activation of MAPK8 then leads to (36) transcriptional activation of CCND1 (Wang et al., 2008). Transcriptional activation of MYC causes (18) transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) which leads to (19, 20) formation of a CDK4 and CCND1 complex (Wang et al 2011). The cyclin-CDK complex then (21) inhibits activity of the retinoblastoma (RB1) transcriptional corepressor 1 which (22) negatively regulates the cell cycle (Burkhart and Sage 2008). Dysregulation of G1/S transition by inhibition of RB1 and/or FOXM1 (23) leads to cell proliferation (Wierstra and Alves 2007; Burkhart and Sage 2008).

MYC can also be activated via hypoxia signaling where an increase in hypoxia (24) decreases the activity of oxygen sensor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha inhibitor (HIF1AN) thereby reducing the ability of HIF1AN to (25) hydroxylate and inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) activity (Whyte et al., 2012; Mahon et al., 2001). Hypoxia also can (26) inhibit activity of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein which has been shown to (27) hydroxylate HIF1A in an O2 dependent manner marking HIF1A for degradation and inactivation in addition to inhibiting expression of HIF1A (Mahon et al., 2001).  In stem cells, activated HIF1A (28) increases expression of TCF/LEF leading to increased expression of genes including MYC (Whyte et al., 2012; Tiburcio et al., 2014).

The long WNT Signaling Pathway Activating noncoding RNA (WSPAR) is often highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and has been found to (29) activate expression of members of the TCF/LEF family (Zhan et al 2017). TCF/LEF transcription factors (30) increase transcription of AXIN2 and increase destruction of beta-catenin in a Wnt signaling negative feedback loop (Jho et al., 2002). TCF/LEF transcription factors form a negative feedback loop that inhibits Wnt signaling by (31) activating transcription of the dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK1) which then (32) binds to the LRP co-receptor (Takigawa and Brown 2008). Finally, cellular G1/S transition can also be dysregulated by (35) phosphorylation of RB1 by the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 10 (PSMD10) which results in an increase in proteosomal degradation of RB1 (Higashitsuji et al., 2005)."

In humans, the major APPs are C reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), while in mice the major APPs are SAA, haptoglobin and serum amyloid P (Cray, Zaias, &amp; Altman, 2009; Gabay &amp; Kushner, 1999). 

It is widely accepted than APPs are mainly produced in the liver, while several other tissues have been shown to express APPs. In humans, APP genes have been shown to be expressed in the adrenal gland, adipose tissue, appendix, gall bladder, heart, kidney, liver, lung, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, skin, small intestine, stomach, thymus, thyroid, trachea and uterus (de Dios et al., 2018; NCBI, 2023; Schr&ouml;dl et al., 2016; Urieli-Shoval, Cohen, Eisenberg, &amp; Matzner, 1998; Venteclef, Jakobsson, Steffensen, &amp; Treuter, 2011). In mice, APPs have been shown to be expressed in the adrenal gland, bladder, central nervous system, colon, duodenum, genital fat pad, heart, kidney, large intestine, limbs, liver, lung, mammary gland, ovary, placenta, small intestine, spleen, subcutaneous fat pad, testis and thymus (Kalmovarin et al., 1991; NCBI, 2023; Saber et al., 2013). 

Table 1 presents a list of acute phase response genes in humans and mice according the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI): Table 1.

It has been shown that in mice, the Saa3 isoform is the most differentially expressed APP gene in lung tissue and it is not highly expressed in the liver, while Saa1 gene is the most differentially expressed in liver tissue after exposure to particles (Halappanavar et al., 2011; Poulsen et al., 2017; Saber et al., 2014)."

In eukaryotes, the mitochondrial electron transport chain mediates a series of redox reactions to create a PMF across the IMM. The PMF is used as energy to drive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis through phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). These processes are coupled and referred to as OXPHOS. A number of chemicals can dissipate the PMF, leading to uncoupling of OXPHOS. This key event describes the main outcome of the interactions between an uncoupler and the transmembrane PMF. An uncoupler can bind to a proton in the mitochondrial inter membrane space, transport the proton to the matrix side of the IMM, release the proton and move back to the inter membrane space. These processes are repeated until the transmembrane PMF is dissipated. This KE is therefore a lumped term of these processes and represents the final consequence of the interactions."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1457","Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition","KE 1457","Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a phenomenon in which the cells transit from epithelial-like into mesenchymal-like phenotypes (Huan et al., 2022; Tanabe, 2017; Tanabe et al., 2015). In cancer, cells exhibiting EMT features contribute to metastasis and drug resistance.

It is known that D-2-hydroxyglurate induces EMT (Guerra et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2018; Sciacovelli &amp; Frezza, 2017). D-2-hydroxyglurate, an inhibitor of Jumonji-family histone demethylase, increased the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) in the promoter region of the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), followed by the induction of EMT (Colvin et al., 2016).

Wnt5a induces EMT and metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer (Wang et al., 2017).

EMT is related to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and is important for treatment-resistant cancer (Tanabe et al., 2016).

TGFbeta induces EMT (Wendt et al., 2010).

ZEB is one of the critical transcription factors for EMT regulation (Zhang et al., 2015).

SNAI1 (Snail) is an important transcription factor for cell differentiation and survival. The phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Snail1 induced by Wnt signaling pathways are critical for the regulation of EMT (Kaufhold &amp; Bonavida, 2014).

Transcription factors SNAI1 and TWIST1 induce EMT (Hodge et al., 2018) (Mani et al., 2008).

It is suggested that Sp1, a transcription factor involved in cell growth and metastasis, is induced by cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), and promotes EMT, which leads to cell proliferation and metastasis (Kwon et al., 2016).


	
		
			
			Biological state

			 

			An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biologic process in which epithelial cells are polarized, interact through their basal surface with basement membrane, and undergo biochemical changes to assume a mesenchymal cell phenotype. 

			This phenotypic transformation has various characters such as enhanced migratory capacity, high invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components (Kalluri,  R.,  and  Neilson,  E.G.  2003). The completion of an EMT is signalled by the degradation of the underlying basement membrane and the formation of a mesenchymal cell that can migrate away from the epithelial layer in which it originated.

			 

			 EMT has a number of distinct molecular processes like activation of transcription factors, expression of specific cell surface proteins, reorganization and expression of cytoskeletal proteins, production of ECM-degrading enzymes, and changes in the expression of specific microRNAs. These factors are used as biomarkers to demonstrate the passage of a  cell through an EMT.

			Cellular

			Role in General Biology:

			Excessive proliferation of epithelial cells and angiogenesis mark the initiation and early growth of primary epithelial cancers. (Hanahan, D., and Weinberg, R.A. 2000). The subsequent acquisition of invasiveness, initially manifest by invasion through the basement membrane, is thought  to herald the onset of the last stages of the multi-step process that  leads eventually to metastatic dissemination, with life-threatening  consequences.  There has been an intense research going on in the genetic controls and biochemical mechanisms underlying the acquisition of the invasive phenotype and the subsequent systemic spread of the cancer cell.  Activation of an EMT program has been proposed as the critical mechanism for the acquisition of malignant phenotypes by epithelial cancer cells (Thiery, J.P. 2002).

			 Pre-clinical experiments such as mice models and cell culture experiments  has demonstrated  that carcinoma cells can acquire a mesenchymal phenotype and express mesenchymal markers such as &alpha;-SMA, FSP1, vimentin,  and desmin (Yang,  J.,  and  Weinberg,  R.A.  2008). These cells  are seen at the invasive front  of primary tumors and are considered to be the cells that eventually  enter into subsequent steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade, i.e.,  intravasation, transport through the circulation, extravasation, formation of micro metastases, and ultimately colonization (the growth  of small colonies into macroscopic metastases) (Thiery, J.P. 2002, Fidler, I.J., and Poste, G. 2008, Brabletz, T., et al. 2001).

			An  apparent  paradox  comes  from  the  observation  that  the  EMT-derived migratory cancer cells typically establish secondary colonies at distant sites that resemble, at the histopathological  level, the primary tumor from which they arose; accordingly,  they no longer exhibit the mesenchymal phenotypes ascribed to  metastasizing  carcinoma  cells.  Reconciling this behaviour with the proposed role of EMT as a facilitator of metastatic dissemination requires the additional notion that metastasizing cancer cells must shed their mesenchymal phenotype via a MET during  the course of secondary tumor formation (Zeisberg, M et al 2005). The tendency of  disseminated cancer cells to undergo EMT likely reflects the local  microenvironments that they encounter after extravasation into  the parenchyma of a distant organ, quite possibly the absence of  the heterotypic signals they experienced in the primary tumor that  were responsible for inducing the EMT in the first place (Thiery, J.P. 2002, Jechlinger, M et al 2002, Bissell, M.J et al 2002). These evidences indicate that induction of an EMT is likely to be a centrally important mechanism for the progression of carcinomas to a metastatic stage and implicates MET during the subsequent colonization process. However, many steps of this mechanistic model still require direct experimental validation. It remains unclear at present whether these phenomena and molecular mechanisms relate to and explain the metastatic dissemination of non-epithelial cancer cells.

			The entire spectrum of signaling agents that contribute to EMTs of carcinoma cells remains unclear. One  theory suggests that  the genetic and epigenetic alterations undergone by cancer cells during the course of primary tumor formation render them especially responsive to EMT-inducing heterotypic signals originating in the tumor-associated stroma. Oncogenes induce senescence, and recent studies suggest that cancer cell EMTs may also play a role in preventing senescence induced by oncogenes, thereby facilitating subsequent aggressive dissemination (Smit, M.A., and Peeper, D.S. 2008, Ansieau, S., et al. 2008, Weinberg, R.A. 2008).  In  the case of many carcinomas, EMT-inducing signals emanating  from the tumor-associated stroma, notably HGF, EGF, PDGF,  and TGF-&beta;, appear to be responsible for the induction or functional  activation  in  cancer  cells  of  a  series  of  EMT-inducing  transcription factors, notably Snail, Slug, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), Twist, Goosecoid, and FOXC2 (Thiery, J.P. 2002, Jechlinger, M  et al 2002, Shi, Y., and Massague, J. 2003, Niessen, K., et al. 2008, Medici, D et al 2008, Kokudo,  T.,  et  al.  2008). Once expressed and activated, each of these transcription factors can act pleiotropically to choreograph the complex EMT program, more often than not with the help of other members of this cohort of transcription factors. The actual implementation by these cells of their EMT program depends on a series of  intracellular signaling networks involving, among other signal- transducing  proteins,  ERK,  MAPK,  PI3K,  Akt,  Smads,  RhoB,  &beta;-catenin, lymphoid enhancer binding factor (LEF), Ras, and c-Fos  as well as cell surface proteins such as &beta;4 integrins, &alpha;5&beta;1 integrin, and &alpha;V&beta;6 integrin (Tse,  J.C.,  and  Kalluri,  R.  2007). Activation of EMT programs is also facilitated by the disruption of cell-cell adherens junctions and the cell-ECM adhesions mediated by integrins (Yang,  J.,  and  Weinberg,  R.A.  2008, Weinberg, R.A. 2008, Gupta, P.B  et al 2005, Yang,  J et al 2006, Mani, S.A., et al. 2007, Mani, S.A., et al. 2008, Hartwell, K.A., et al. 2006, Taki, M et al 2006).."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1458","Pulmonary fibrosis","KE 1458","Pulmonary fibrosis is broadly defined as the thickening or scarring of lung tissue, due to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. In the normal human lung, the nasopharynx and the conducting airways are mainly covered by epithelium composed of ciliated, mucous secreting cells in direct contact with the basement membrane with submucosal glands containing goblet, duct, and serous cells also contributing to the fluid balance and mucous production (Koval and Sidhaye, 2017). Within this epithelium, basal cells are found which are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate in response to injury (Koval and Sidhaye, 2017). Further down the lung, in the terminal bronchiole region, the epithelium does not contain submucosal glands, but instead contains club cells which produce pulmonary surfactant and can differentiate into bronchiolar or alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Finally, in the terminal airspaces, the epithelium is made up entirely of type I and type II AECs. In between the two adjacent alveoli are two layers of alveolar epithelium resting on basement membrane, which consists of interstitial space, pulmonary capillaries, elastin and collagen fibres. Thus, the alveolar capillary membrane (ACM), where gas exchange takes place, is made up of the alveolar epithelium and alveolar endothelium (Gracey et al, 1968). In pulmonary fibrosis, damage to the pulmonary epithelium results in excessive deposition of collagen by constitutively activated myofibroblasts during the wound healing response. This causes a pronounced decrease in the number of capillaries within the alveolar septa with asymmetric deposition of collagen and cells between part of the surface of a capillary and the nearby alveolar lining. In areas where capillaries are not present, the ACM is occupied with collagen and cells."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1461","Increase, DNA double-strand breaks","KE 1461","DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is formed as a consequence of the production of excision repair breaks opposite each other on the two strands of DNA, and by the production of an excision repair break opposite a DNA daughter-strand gap. DSB are considered to be critical primary lesions in the formation of chromosomal aberrations.

To repare this potentially lethal damage, eukaryotic cells have evolved a variety of repair pathways related to homologous and illegitimate recombination, also called non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), which may induce small scale mutations and chromosomal aberration (Pfeiffer et al. 2000). Repair by NHEJ often leads to small deletions at the site of the DSB and is considered error prone. The second repair mechanism, the Homologous Recombination (HR) is directed by extensive homology in a partner DNA molecule. In mitotic cells NHEJ occurs throughout all phases of the cell cycle, whereas HR is largely restricted to the S and G2 phases when the sister chromatid is available to mediate the repair process (Reynard et al. 2017). Persistent or incorrectly repaired DSBs can result in chromosome loss, deletion, translocation, or fusion, which can lead to carcinogenesis through activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (Raynard et al.2017). The DSB repair pathways apper to compete for DSBs, but the balance between them differs widely among species, between different cell types of a single species, and during different cell cycle phases of a single cell type. (Shrivastav et al. 2008).

DSBs are induced by agents such as ionizing radiation and chemicals that directly or indirectly damage DNA and are commonly used in cancer therapy (Shrivastav et al. 2008). DSBs also arise during DNA replication when the DNA-polymerase ensemble encounters obstacles such as DNA lesions or unusual DNA structures (Raynard et al 2017). Additional endogenous sources include reactive oxygen species, generated during cellular metabolism, collapsed replication forks and nucleases(Shrivastav et al. 2008) ."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1477","Decrease, Oxidative phosphorylation","KE 1477","Oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which reducing equivalents (NADH, FADH2) produced from catabolism of carbohydrates or fatty acid are further metabolised in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) to produce ATP. This is done by a set of enzymes that responsible for building a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that allows ATP production by the ATP synthase. When this chain is interrupted (e.g. interference by ROS, dissipation of the proton gradient, loss of integrity of the mitochondrial membranes), oxidative phosphorylation is decreased and ATP production by this means is impaired.

The dissipation of the proton gradient results in a loss of the highly negative mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and a depletion of ATP. When the ETC is blocked, a decrease in O2 consumption rate can also be observed, as O2 is consumed to pump the protons into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1487","Binding, Thiol/seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress","KE 1487","In the brain, thiol (SH)- and seleno-containing proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress are mainly located in mitochondria and in the cytoplasm of the different neural cell types (Comini, 2016; Hoppe et al. 2008; Barbosa et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2017). The main SH-containing peptide involved in protection against oxidative stress is Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide acting as a cofactor for the enzyme peroxidase and thus serving as an indirect antioxidant donating the electrons necessary for its decomposition of H2O2. The seleno-containing proteins of interest are: (i) the Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) family, involved in detoxification of hydroperoxides; (ii) the Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) family, involved in the regeneration of reduced thioredoxin (Pillai et al., 2014; ), and the less studied SelH, K, S, R, W, and P selenoproteins (Pisoschi and Pop, 2015, Reeves and Hoffmann, 2009). Binding of chemicals to these proteins induces either their inactivation or favor their degradation (Farina et al. 2009; Zemolin et al. 2012). Of particular importance, the GSH/GPx and thioredoxin (Trx)/TrxR systems are the two main redox regulators of mammalian cells and the disruption of their activities can compromise cell viability (Ren et al. 2016)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1488","Glutamate dyshomeostasis","KE 1488","Glutamate (Glu) is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), where it plays major roles in multiple aspects, such as development, learning, memory and response to injury (Featherstone, 2010). However, it is well recognized that Glu at high concentrations at the synaptic cleft acts as a toxin, inducing neuronal injury and death (Meldrum, 2000; Ozawa et al., 1998) secondary to activation of glumatergic N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and Ca2+ influx. Glu dyshomeostasis is a consequence of perturbation of  astrocyte/neuron interactions and the transport of this amino acid, as will be discussed below.

Astrocytes are critically involved in neuronal function and survival, as they produce neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), as well as express two main glutamate transporters responsible for the removal of excessive Glu from the synaptic clefts (Chai et al., 2013; Sheldon et al., 2007). Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, playing a major role in memory and cognitive function (Platt, 1997), and Glu transporters as such prevent the overstimulation of post-synaptic glutamate receptors that lead to excitotoxic neuronal injury (Sattler et al., 2001; Dobble, 1999). Among the five subtypes of Glu transporters identified, glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and Glu transporter-1 (GLT-1) [excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1 and 2 in humans, respectively], are predominantly expressed in astrocytes. They are responsible for the uptake of excess glutamate from the extracellular space (Furuta et al., 1997; Lehre et al., 1995; Tanaka, 2000), supported by the fact that knockdown of either GLT-1 or GLAST in mice increases extracellular glutamate levels, leading to excitotoxicity related neurodegeneration and progressive paralysis (Bristol and Rothstein, 1996). In the adult brain, EAAT2 accounts for &gt;90% of extracellular glutamate clearance (Danbolt, 2001; Kim et al., 2011; Rothstein et al., 1995), and genetic deletion of both alleles of GLT-1 in mice leads to the development of lethal seizures (Rothstein et al., 1996). On the other hand, EAAT1-3 play a major role during human brain development, in particular in corticogenesis, where they are expressed in proliferative zones and in radial glia, and alterations of Glu transporters contributes to disorganized cortex seen in migration disorders (Furuta et al., 2005;Regan et al., 2007). Indeed, disruption of glutamate signaling is thought to be part of the etiology underlying some neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (Chiocchetti et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2012). Genes involved in glutamatergic pathways, affecting receptor signalling, metabolism and transport, were enriched in genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorders (Chiocchetti et al, 2014).

Extracellular Glu released by neurons is taken up by astrocytes, which is converted into glutamine (Gln) by glutamine synthetase (GS), a thiol-containing enzyme (cf MIE, Binding to SH-/seleno containing proteins). Intercellular compartmentation of Gln and Glu, the so-called Gln/Glu-GABA cycle (GGC), is critical for optimal CNS function.13C NMR studies have demonstrated that the ratio of Gln/Glu is extremely high and increases with brain activity (Shen et al., 1999). Thus the GGC gives rise to the amino acid neurotransmitters Glu and GABA via dynamic astrocyte neuron interactions. Glu released at synaptic terminals is taken up by surrounding astrocytes via GLT-1 and GLAST (Rothstein et al., 1994; 1996). A small proportion of the astrocytic formed Gln via a reaction mediated by GS is transported into the extracellular space by Gln carriers, with a predominant role for System N/A transporter (SNAT3), which belongs to the bidirectional transporter System N (Chaudhry et al., 2002).

In addition to System N, release of Gln from astrocytes is mediated by other transport systems, including Systems L (LAT2) and ASC (ASCT2). Extracellular Gln is taken up into GABAergic and Glu-ergic neurons by the unidirectional System A transporters SNAT1 (Melone et al., 2004) and SNAT2 (Grewal et al., 2009). Once in neurons, Gln is converted to Glu by the mitochondrial enzyme phosphate-activated glutaminase (Kvamme et al., 2001). Additionally, Glu is packaged into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular VGLUT transporter (Bellocchio et al., 1998), released into the extracellular space and taken up by astrocytes where it is converted back to Gln by GS, thus completing the GGC (Fig. 1).

Activation refers to a phenotypic modification of the resident cells that includes alterations in their secretions, activation of biosynthetic pathways, production of pro-inflammatory proteins and lipids, and morphological changes. While these represent a pleiotropic range of responses that can vary with the tissue, there are a number of common markers or signs of activation that are measurable. 

Examples of Common markers are 


	
	 CD11b 
	



	
	 Iba1 
	



	
	 GFAP  CD68  CD86 
	



	
	 Mac-1  NF-kB  AP-1 
	



	
	 Jnk 
	



	
	 P38/MAPK 
	


These described commonalities allow the use of this KE as a hub KE in the AOP network. However, despite the similarities in the inflammatory process, the type of reactive cells and the molecules triggering their reactivity may be tissue-specific. Therefore, for practical reasons, a tissue specific description of the reactive cells and of the triggering factors is necessary in order to specify in a tissue-specific manner, which cell should be considered and what should be measured. 

 

Brain 

The most easily detectable feature of brain inflammation or neuroinflammation is activation of microglial cells and astrocytes. It is evidenced by changes in shape, increased expression of certain antigens, and accumulation and proliferation of the glial cells in affected regions (Aschner, 1998; Graeber &amp; Streit, 1990; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Streit et al, 1999; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Claycomb et al., 2013). Upon stimulation by cytokines, chemokines or inflammogens (e.g. from pathogens or from damaged neurons), both glial cell types activate inflammatory signaling pathways, which result in increased expression and/or release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, eicosanoids, and metalloproteinases (Dong &amp; Benveniste, 2001) (cf KE: pro- inflammatory mediators, increased), as well as in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) (Brown &amp; Bal-Price, 2003). Different types of activation states are possible for microglia and astrocytes, resulting in pro- inflammatory or anti-inflammatory signaling, and other cellular functions (such as phagocytosis) (Streit et al., 1999; Nakajima and Kohsaka, 2004). Therefore, neuroinflammation can have both neuroprotective/neuroreparative and neurodegenerative consequences (Carson et al., 2006; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Aguzzi et al., 2013 ; Glass et al., 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, microglial cells survey the nervous system for neuronal integrity (Nimmerjahn et al, 2005) and for invading pathogens (Aloisi, 2001; Kreutzberg, 1995; Kreutzberg, 1996; Rivest, 2009). They are the first type of cell activated (first line of defense), and can subsequently induce astrocyte activation (Falsig, 2008). Two distinct states of microglial activation have been described (Gordon, 2003; Kigerl et al, 2009; Maresz et al, 2008; Mosser &amp; Edwards, 2008; Perego et al; Ponomarev et al, 2005): The M1 state is classically triggered by interferon-gamma and/or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and this state is characterized by increased expression of integrin alpha M (Itgam) and CD86, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL- 1beta, IL-6), and it is mostly associated with neurodegeneration. The M2 state is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 (Maresz et al, 2008; Perego et al, 2011; Ponomarev et al, 2007) and induces the expression of mannose receptor 1 (MRC1), arginase1 (Arg 1) and Ym1/2; it is involved in repair processes. The activation of astrocytes by microglia-derived cytokines or TLR agonists resembles the microglial M1 state (Falsig 2006). Although classification of the M1/M2 polarization of microglial cells may be considered as a simplification of authentic microglial reaction states (Ransohoff, 2016), a similar polarization of reactive astrocytes has been described recently Liddlelow et al., 2017): Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a), TNF and subcomponent q (C1q) released by activated microglial cells induce A1-reactive astrocytes, which lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1493","Increased Pro-inflammatory mediators","KE 1493","Inflammatory mediators are soluble, diffusible molecules that act locally at the site of tissue damage and infection, and at more distant sites. They can be divided into exogenous and endogenous mediators. 

Exogenous mediators of inflammation are bacterial products or toxins like endotoxin or lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Endogenous mediators of inflammation are produced from within the (innate and adaptive) immune system itself, as well as other systems. They can be derived from molecules that are normally present in the plasma in an inactive form, such as peptide fragments of some components of complement, coagulation, and kinin systems. Or they can be released at the site of injury by a number of cell types that either contain them as preformed molecules within storage granules, e.g. histamine, or which can rapidly switch on the machinery required to synthesize the mediators. 

This event occurs equally in various tissues and does not require tissue-specific descriptions. Nevertheless, there are some specificities such as the release of glutamate by brain reactive glial cells (Brown &amp; Bal-Price, 2003; Vesce et al., 2007). The differences may rather reside in the type of insult favouring the increased expression and/or release of a specific class of inflammatory mediators, as well the time after the insult reflecting different stages of the inflammatory process. For these reasons, the analyses of the changes of a battery of inflammatory mediators rather than of a single one is a more adequate measurement of this KE

The increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators can have negative consequences on the parenchymal cells leading even to cell death, as described for TNF-a or peroxynitrite on neurons (Chao et al, 1995; Brown and Bal-Price, 2003). Along with TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta; and IL-6 have been shown to exhibit negative consequences on neurogenesis and neuronal precursor cell proliferation when overexpressed. IFN-&gamma; is also associated with neuronal damage, although it is not as extensively studied compared to TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta; and IL-6.  In addition, via a feedback loop, they can act on the reactive resident cells thus maintaining or exacerbating their reactive state; and by modifying elements of their signalling pathways, they can favour the M1 phenotypic polarization and the chronicity of the inflammatory process (Taetzsch et al., 2015).

Basically, this event occurs equally in various tissues and does not require tissue-specific descriptions. Nevertheless, there are some specificities such as the release of glutamate by brain reactive glial cells (Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Vesce et al., 2007). The differences may rather reside in the type of insult favouring the increased expression and/or release of a specific class of inflammatory mediators, as well the time after the insult reflecting different stages of the inflammatory process. For these reasons, the analyses of the changes of a battery of inflammatory mediators rather than of a single one is a more adequate measurement of this KE.

Regulatory examples using the KE

CD54 and CD 86 as well as IL-8 expression is used to assess skin sensitization potential (OECD TG 442E). IL-2 expression is used to assess immunotoxicity (and will become an OECD test guideline); for the latter see also doi: 10.1007/s00204-018-2199-7. 

 

LIVER:

When activated, resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) release inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, lysosomal, and proteolytic enzymes and are a main source of TGF-&beta;1 - the most potent pro-fibrogenic cytokine. Following the role of TGF-&beta; is described in more detail.

Transforming growth factor &beta; (TGF-&beta;) is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent regulatory and inflammatory activity [Sanjabi et al., 2009; Li and Flavell, 2008a;2008b]. The multi-faceted effects of TGF-&beta; on numerous immune functions are cellular and environmental context dependent [Li et al., 2006]. TGF-&beta; binds to TGF-&beta; receptor II (TGF-&beta;RII) triggering the kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain that in turn activates TGF-&beta;RI. The activated receptor complex leads to nuclear translocation of Smad molecules, and transcription of target genes [Li et al., 2006a]. The role of TGF-&beta; as an immune modulator of T cell activity is best exemplified by the similarities between TGF-&beta;1 knockout and T cell specific TGF-&beta; receptor II knockout mice [Li et al., 2006b; Marie et al., 2006;Shull et al., 1992]. The animals in both of these models develop severe multi-organ autoimmunity and succumb to death within a few weeks after birth [Li et al., 2006b; Marie et al., 2006; Shull et al., 1992]. In addition, in mice where TGF-&beta; signaling is blocked specifically in T cells, the development of natural killer T (NKT) cells, natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells, and CD8+ T cells was shown to be dependent on TGF-&beta; signaling in the thymus [Li et al., 2006b; Marie et al., 2006].

TGF-&beta; plays a major role under inflammatory conditions. TGF-&beta; in the presence of IL-6 drives the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which can promote further inflammation and augment autoimmune conditions [Korn et al., 2009]. TGF-&beta; orchestrates the differentiation of both Treg and Th17 cells in a concentration-dependent manner [Korn et al., 2008]. In addition, TGF-&beta; in combination with IL-4, promotes the differentiation of IL-9- and IL-10-producing T cells, which lack suppressive function and also promote tissue inflammation [Dardalhon  et al., 2008; Veldhoen et al., 2008]. The biological effects of TGF-&beta; under inflammatory conditions on effector and memory CD8+ T cells are much less understood. In a recent study, it was shown that TGF-&beta; has a drastically opposing role on na&iuml;ve compared to antigen-experienced/memory CD8+ T cells [Filippi et al., 2008]. When cultured in vitro, TGF-&beta; suppressed na&iuml;ve CD8+ T cell activation and IFN-&gamma; production, whereas TGF-&beta; enhanced survival of memory CD8+ T cells and increased the production of IL-17 and IFN-&gamma; [Filippi et al., 2008]. TGF-&beta; also plays an important role in suppressing the cells of the innate immune system.

The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&beta;) family of cytokines are ubiquitous, multifunctional, and essential to survival. They play important roles in growth and development, inflammation and repair, and host immunity. The mammalian TGF-&beta; isoforms (TGF-&beta;1, &beta;2 and &beta;3) are secreted as latent precursors and have multiple cell surface receptors of which at least two mediate signal transduction. Autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF-&beta;s can be modified by extracellular matrix, neighbouring cells and other cytokines. The vital role of the TGF-&beta; family is illustrated by the fact that approximately 50% of TGF-1 gene knockout mice die in utero and the remainder succumb to uncontrolled inflammation after birth. The role of TGF-&beta; in homeostatic and pathogenic processes suggests numerous applications in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases characterised by inflammation and fibrosis. [Clark and Coker, 1998; Santiba&ntilde;ez et al., 2011; Pohlers et al., 2009] Abnormal TGF-&beta; regulation and function are implicated in a growing number of fibrotic and inflammatory pathologies, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, Marfan syndrome, hypertrophic scars, systemic sclerosis, myocarditis, and Crohn&rsquo;s disease. [Gordon and Globe,2008] TGF-&beta;1 is a polypeptide member of the TGF-&beta; superfamily of cytokines. TGF-&beta; is synthesized as a non-active pro-form, forms a complex with two latent associated proteins latency-associated protein (LAP) and latent TGF- &beta; binding protein (LTBP) and undergoes protolithic cleavage by the endopeptidase furin to generate the mature TGF-&beta; dimer. Among the TGF-&beta;s, six distinct isoforms have been discovered although only the TGF-&beta;1, TGF-&beta;2 and TGF-&beta;3 isoforms are expressed in mammals, and their human genes are located on chromosomes 19q13, 1q41 and 14q24, respectively. Out of the three TGF-&beta; isoforms (&beta;1, &beta;2 and &beta;3) only TGF-&beta;1 was linked to fibrogenesis and is the most potent fibrogenic factor for hepatic stellate cells. [Roberts, 1998; Govinden and Bhoola, 2003]. During fibrogenesis, tissue and blood levels of active TGF-&beta; are elevated and overexpression of TGF-&beta;1 in transgenic mice can induce fibrosis. Additionally, experimental fibrosis can be inhibited by anti-TGF-&beta; treatments with neutralizing antibodies or soluble TGF-&beta; receptors [Qi et al.; 1999; Shek and Benyon , 2004; De Gouville et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2009]. TGF-&beta;1 induces its own mRNA to sustain high levels in local sites of injury. The effects of TGF-&beta;1 are classically mediated by intracellular signalling via Smad proteins. Smads 2 and 3 are stimulatory whereas Smad 7 is inhibitory. [Parsons et al., 2013; Friedman, 2008; Kubiczkova et al., 2012] Smad1/5/8, MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein) and PI3 kinase are further signalling pathways in different cell types for TGF-&beta;1 effects.

TGF-&beta; is found in all tissues, but is particularly abundant in bone, lung, kidney and placental tissue. TGF-&beta; is produced by many, but not all parenchymal cell types, and is also produced or released by infiltrating cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets. Following wounding or inflammation, all these cells are potential sources of TGF-&beta;. In general, the release and activation of TGF-&beta; stimulates the production of various extracellular matrix proteins and inhibits the degradation of these matrix proteins [Branton and Kopp, 1999]. TGF-&beta; 1 is produced by every leukocyte lineage, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and its expression serves in both autocrine and paracrine modes to control the differentiation, proliferation, and state of activation of these immune cells. [Letterio and Roberts; 1998]

In the liver TGF-&beta;1 is released by activated Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and platelets; in the further course of events also activated hepatic stellate cells express TGF-&beta;1. Hepatocytes do not produce TGF-&beta;1 but are implicated in intracellular activation of latent TGF-&beta;1. [Roth et al., 1998; Kisseleva and Brenner, 2007; Kisseleva and Brenner, 2008; Poli, 2000; Liu et al., 2006]

TGF-&beta;1 is the most established mediator and regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) which further contributes to the production of extracellular matrix. It has been shown that TGF-&beta;1 mediates EMT by inducing snail-1 transcription factor and tyrosine phosphorylation of Smad2/3 with subsequent recruitment of Smad4. [Kolios et al., 2006; Bataller and Brenner, 2005; Guo and Friedman,2007; Brenner,2009; Kaimori et al., 2007; Gressner et al., 2002; Kershenobich Stalnikowitz and Weisssbrod, 2003; Li et al., 2008; Matsuoka and Tsukamoto, 1990; Kisseleva and Brenner, 2008; Poli, 200; Parsons et al., 2007; Friedman 2008; Liu et al., 2006]

TGF-&beta;1 induces apoptosis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) High levels of VEGF and TGF-&beta;1 are present in many tumors. Crosstalk between the signalling pathways activated by these growth factors controls endothelial cell apoptosis and angiogenesis. [Clark and Coker; 1998]"
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1494","Leukocyte recruitment/activation","KE 1494","The inflammatory response is the cornerstone of the body&rsquo;s defense mechanism against bacterial and viral pathogens, as well as physical-, chemical- and environmental-mediated tissue and organ damage. Leucocyte recruitment at the site of pathogen evasion or sterile tissue injury is a critical adaptation for the preservation of tissue integrity. Neutrophils are the cell population that acutely responds to the alterations of inflammatory micro-environment. Neutrophil infiltration takes place within 6-8 hours from the initiation of the inflammatory process and is followed by the recruitment of other cell populations, like monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, which either promote or drive the resolution of inflammation. Leukocyte infiltration into sites of infection or sterile inflammation is a tightly regulated process that follows a sequence of adhesive events, termed as leukocyte adhesion cascade. One can broadly generalize that most leukocytes follow a similar multi-step cascade in the peripheral (non-lymphoid) vasculature with some exceptions. Accordingly, an updated adhesion cascade in postcapillary venules involves free-flowing leukocytes initial attachment or tethering and slow velocity rolling (step 1),stable adhesion (arrest) on endothelial cells (step 2), leukocyte flattening (step 3), and subsequent crawling on the vascular endothelium, transendothelial cell migration (TEM) between (paracellular route) or through (transcellular) the vascular endothelium (step 4), and uropod elongation to complete transmigration of postcapillary venules (step 5). The initial attachment and rolling steps are initiated by interactions of endothelial E- and P-selectins and their counterreceptors on leukocytes L-selectin (Leick et al., 2014).

Each of these steps is necessary for effective leukocyte recruitment; these steps are not phases of inflammation, but represent the sequence of events from the perspective of each leukocyte. At any given moment they all happen in parallel, involving different leukocytes in the same microvessels.

From the initial selectin-dependent leukocyte tethering to endothelial cells to the final migration of leukocytes into the sub-endothelium, this process depends on the interplay between leukocyte receptors and endothelial cell counter-receptors, as well as on the presence of endogenous inhibitors of leukocyte adhesion enabling the targeted recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues.

To enable the infiltration of leukocytes at the site of inflammation, a series of alterations in endothelial cells and leukocytes takes place:


	regulation of the expression of adhesion molecules in leukocytes
	increased secretion of chemokines by endothelial cells
	increased expression of adhesion molecules in the luminal surface of endothelial cells


(Kourtzelis and Mitroulis, 2015) (Robbins and Cotran: Pathologic Basis of Disease 2010).

After recruitment, activation includes phenotype modification with morphologic alterations, changes in marker proteins (MHC, adhesion molecules, co-stimulatory signal), expression of mediators, enzymes, and pro-inflammatory proteins/lipids. Recruited monocytes recruited mature into macrophages with phagocytic activity and elaboration of a myriad of mediators of inflammation. The macrophage can replicate within tissues or die, including by apoptosis."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1495","Substance interaction with the lung resident cell membrane components","KE 1495","The human lung consists of approximately 40 different resident cell types that play different roles during homeostasis, injury, repair and disease states (Franks et al., 2008; Luettich et al., 2021). Of these, resident airway epithelial cells, alveolar/interstitial macrophages and dendritic cells are well characterised for their ability to sense the danger upon interaction with harmful substances and relay the message to mount the necessary immune/inflammatory response. The resident macrophages are present in all tissues, and in a steady state, macrophages contribute to epithelial integrity, survey the tissue for invading pathogens or chemicals and maintain an immunosuppressive environment. Their main function is to clear the incoming irritants and microbes. They are named differently based on the tissue type and their specific functions (Kierdorf et al., 2015).


Substance interactions:


The chemicals or pathogens interact with cellular membrane to gain access to the organisms&rsquo; interior. A predominant interaction mechanism involves the recognition of innate immune response agonists by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present on resident cells such as epithelial and alveolar macrophages. PRRs are also present on other immune and parenchymal cells. PRRs can be activated by two classes of ligands. Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are microbial molecules derived from invading pathogens. PAMPs will not be discussed further as pathogens are not the focus for the AOP presented here. The other class of ligands are called danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that include cellular fragments, nucleic acids, small molecules, proteins and even cytokines released from injured or dying cells (Bianchi, 2007). Most fibrogenic stressors discussed in this AOP act via DAMPs-driven PRR activation. High aspect ratio (HAR) materials such as asbestos or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) pierce the cellular membrane of epithelial cells or resident macrophages resulting in cell injury or non-programmed cellular death. Alveolar macrophages trying to engulf HAR fibres that are long and stiff undergo frustrated phagocytosis because of their inability to engulf the piercing fibres and subsequently lead to cell injury (Boyles et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2007; Donaldson K et al., 2010; D&ouml;rger et al., 2001; Mossman and Churg, 1998). The cellular debris from injured or dying cell then serves as ligands for PRRs (Nakayama, 2018), leading to cell activation. In case of pro-fibrotic insoluble particles such as silica, coal dust and nanomaterials (NMs), the particle adsorbed opsonins such as immunoglobulins, complement proteins, or serum proteins act as ligands to the receptors on the macrophage cell surface (Behzadi et al., 2017). The tissue response to these materials resembles that observed following foreign body invasion in lungs. 

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are highly conserved PRRs that are associated with fibrogenic stressors (Desai et al., 2018). Inhibition of TLR-4 is protective against bleomycin-induced fibrosis (Li et al., 2015). However, the exact role and mechanisms by which TLRs mediate lung fibrosis are yet to be uncovered and some studies have shown TLRs to be protective against lung fibrosis (Desai et al., 2018). Asbestos and silica crystals are suggested to engage scavenger receptors present on the macrophages. Mice deficient in class A scavenger macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) are shown to induce reduced fibrogenic response following chrysotile asbestos exposure; although, the direct binding of MARCO by asbestos is not investigated in the study (Murthy et al., 2015). In case of soluble substances such as bleomycin, paraquat (Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2008) (N,N&#39;-dimethyl-4, 4&prime;-bipyridinium dichloride) and other soluble fibrogenic chemicals, direct damage of lung epithelial cells and resulting cellular debris or secreted cytokines (DAMPs) serve as triggers for downstream cascading pro-inflammatory events, tissue injury and fibrosis. Engagement of PRRs and consequent cell activation is observed in various organisms including flies and mammals (Denholm and Phan, 1990; Matzinger, 2002)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1496","Increased, secretion of proinflammatory mediators","KE 1496","Pro-inflammatory mediators are the chemical and biological molecules that initiate and regulate inflammatory reactions. Pro-inflammatory mediators are secreted following exposure to an inflammogen in a gender/sex or developmental stage independent manner. They are secreted during inflammation in all species. Different types of pro-inflammatory mediators are secreted during innate or adaptive immune responses across various species (Mestas and Hughes, 2004). Cell-derived pro-inflammatory mediators include cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Blood derived pro-inflammatory mediators include vasoactive amines, complement activation products and others. These modulators can be grouped based on the cell type that secrete them, their cellular localisation and also based on the type of immune response they trigger. For example, members of the interleukin (IL) family including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21, IL-3, IL-5 and Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are involved in the adaptive immune responses. The pro-inflammatory cytokines include IL-1 family (IL-1&alpha; , IL-1&beta;, IL-1r&alpha;, IL-18, IL-36&alpha;, IL-36&beta;, IL-36&gamma;, IL-36R&alpha;, IL-37), IL-6 family, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, IL-17, and Interferon gamma (IFN-&gamma;) (Turner et al., 2014). While IL-4 and IL-5 are considered T helper (Th) cell type 2 response, IFN-&gamma; is suggested to be Th1 type response.

Different types of pro-inflammatory mediators are secreted during innate or adaptive immune responses across various species (Mestas and Hughes, 2004). However, IL-1 family cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, IFN-&gamma; are the commonly measured mediators in experimental animals and in humans. Similar gene expression patterns involving inflammation and matrix remodelling are observed in human patients of pulmonary fibrosis and mouse lungs exposed to bleomycin (Kaminski, 2002). 

Literature evidence for its perturbation:

Several studies show increased proinflammatory mediators in rodent lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and in cell culture supernatants following exposure to a variety of carbon nanotube (CNT) types and other materials. Poland et al., 2008 showed that long and thin CNTs (&gt;5 &micro;m) can elicit asbestos-like pathogenicity through the continual release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Exposure to crystalline silica induces release of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&alpha;, IL-1, IL-6), transcription factors (Nuclear factor kappa B [NF-&kappa;B], Activator protein-1 [AP-1]) and kinase signalling pathways in mice that contain NF-&kappa;B luciferase reporter (Hubbard et al., 2002). Boyles et al., 2015 found that lung responses to long multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) included high expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediators Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&beta;1), and TNF-&alpha; (Boyles et al., 2015). Bleomycin administration in rodents induces lung inflammation and increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (Park et al., 2019). Inflammation induced by bleomycin, paraquat and CNTs is characterised by the altered expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. A large number of nanomaterials induce expression of cytokines and chemokines in lungs of rodents exposed via inhalation (Halappanavar et al., 2011; Husain et al., 2015a). Similarities are observed in gene programs involving pro-inflammatory event is observed in both humans and experimental mice (Zuo et al., 2002)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1497","Increased, recruitment of inflammatory cells","KE 1497","Pro-inflammatory cells originate in bone marrow and are recruited to the site of infection or injury via circulation following specific pro-inflammatory mediator (cytokine and chemokine) signalling. Pro-inflammatory cells are recruited to lungs to clear the invading pathogen or the toxic substance. Monocytes (dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) are subsets of circulating white blood cells that are involved in the immune responses to pathogen or toxicant stimuli (Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013; Kopf et al., 2015). They are derived from the bone marrow. They can differentiate into different macrophage types and dendritic cells. They can be categorised based on their size, the type of cell surface receptors and their ability to differentiate following external or internal stimulus such as increased expression of cytokines. Monocytes participate in tissue healing, clearance of toxic substance or pathogens, and in the initiation of adaptive immunity. Recruited monocytes can also influence pathogenesis (Ingersoll et al., 2011). Sensing or recognition of pathogens and harmful substances results in the recruitment of monocytes to lungs (Shi and Pamer, 2011). Activated immune cells secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, the purpose of which is to propagate the immune signalling and response, which when not controlled, leads to chronic inflammation, cell death and tissue injury. Thus, Event 1496 and Event 1497 act in a positive feedback loop mechanism and propagate the proinflammatory environment. 

Literature evidence for its perturbation:

Macrophages accumulate in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) post-exposure to bleomycin (Phan et al., 1980; Smith et al., 1995). Nanomaterial (NM)-induced inflammation is predominantly neutrophilic (Poulsen et al., 2015; Rahman L et al., 2017a; Rahman et al., 2017b; Shvedova et al., 2005). An increased number of neutrophils (Reynolds et al., 1977) is observed in the BALF of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cells and a type of granulocytes (contain granules and enzymes) that are recruited following exposure to allergens, during allergic reactions such as asthma or during fibrosis (Reynolds et al., 1977). Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) induce increased eosinophil count in lungs (K&oslash;bler C et al., 2015). MWCNTs act as allergens and induce lung infiltration of eosinophils and cause airway hypersensitivity (Beamer et al., 2013). 

It is important to note that the stressor-induced Event 1495, Event 1496, and Event 1497 are part of the functional changes that we collectively consider as inflammation, and together, they mark the initiation of acute inflammatory phase. Event 1495 and Event 1496 occur at the cellular level. Event 1497 occurs at the tissue level."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1498","Loss of alveolar capillary membrane integrity","KE 1498","The alveolar-capillary membrane (ACM) is the gas exchange surface of the lungs that is only ~0.3&micro;m thick and is the largest surface area within the lung that separates the interior of the body from the environment. It is comprised of the microvascular endothelium, interstitium, and alveolar epithelium. As a consequence of its anatomical position, and the large surface area, it is the first point of contact for any inhaled pathogen, particles or toxic substances. Thus, ACM is subjected to injury constantly and rapidly repaired following the external insults without formation of fibrosis or scar tissue. The extent of ACM injury or how rapidly its integrity is restored is a pivotal determinant of whether the lung restores its normal functioning following an injury or is replaced by fibrotic lesion or scar tissue (Fukuda et al., 1987; Schwarz et al., 2001). Significant loss of endothelium and epithelium of the ACM results in loss of the barrier and membrane integrity. Increased membrane permeability leading to efflux of protein-rich fluid into the peribronchovascular interstitium and the distal airspaces of the lung, disruption of normal fluid transport via downregulated Na+ channels or malfunctioning Na+/K+ATPase pumps, loss of surfactant production, increased expression of epithelial or endothelial cell markers such as Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) or decreased expression of surfactant protein D (SP-D) are few of the markers of decreasing lung compliance arising from the lost integrity of ACM (Johnson and Matthay, 2010).

Literature evidence for its perturbation:

Bleomycin exposure causes alveolar barrier dysfunction (Miyoshi et al., 2013). Cigarette smoke impairs tight junction proteins and leads to altered permeability of the epithelial barrier (Schamberger et al., 2014). Exposure to bleomycin destroys the structural architecture of tight junctions, increases permeability, epithelial death and loss of specialised repair proteins such as claudins. Thoracic radiation and bleomycin induced lung injury results in decreased expression of E-cadherin and Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) expression (Almeida et al., 2013; Gabazza et al., 2004).

Repeated exposure to biopersistent toxic substances, pathogens or lung irritants initiate non-resolving inflammation and ACM injury (Costabel et al., 2012). Chronic inflammation mediated by overexpression of cytokines such as Interleukine (IL)-1 (Kolb et al., 2001), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;) (Sime et al., 1998), T helper type 2 cytokine IL-13 or exposure to specific proteinases initiate ACM injury, leading to significant loss of the epithelium and endothelium of the ACM resulting loss of barrier integrity. In patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), both type 1 pneumocyte &amp; endothelial cell injury with ACM barrier loss is observed. 

Bleomycin and silica exposure generate persistent inflammation and lung damage (Chua et al., 2005; Thrall and Scaliso, 1995). Exposure to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) induces persistent inflammation, granuloma formation and diffuse intestinal fibrosis in mice after pharyngeal aspiration (Shvedova et al., 2005). Multi-walled carbon nanotubes act as allergens and induce lung infiltration of eosinophils and cause airway hypersensitivity (Beamer et al., 2013). Inhaled particles induce chronic inflammation (Ernst et al., 2002; Hamilton et al., 2008; Thakur et al., 2008). Increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils are observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients suffering from IPF and chronic inflammation is associated with decreased survival (Parra et al., 2007; Schwartz et al., 1991; Yasuoka et al., 1985).

The BALF of patients diagnosed with interstitial diseases contains increased levels of 8-isoprostane (Psathakis et al., 2006) and carbonyl-modified proteins (Lenz et al., 1996), markers of oxidative modification of lipids and proteins. In vivo, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in rodents (Ghio et al., 1998) and enzymatic production of nitric oxide in rat alveolar macrophages is observed after asbestos exposure (Quinlan et al., 1998). Some nanoparticles induce oxidative stress that contributes to cellular toxicity (Shi et al., 2012). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase derived ROS is a critical determinant of the pulmonary response to SWCNTs in mice (Shvedova et al., 2008). Oxidative lipidomics analysis of the lungs of carbon nanotube (CNT)-exposed mice showed, phospholipid oxidation (Tyurina et al., 2011). ROS synthesis is suggested to be important for inflammosome activation involving NLR-related protein 3 complex, activated caspase-1 and IL-1&beta;, which is observed following exposure to a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli including, asbestos and crystalline silica (Cassel et al., 2008; Dostert et al., 2008) and long needle-like CNTs. In the case of asbestos, frustrated phagocytosis triggered ROS synthesis leads to inflammosome activation, which is associated with asbestos induced pathology (Dostert et al., 2008)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1499","Increased, activation of T (T) helper (h) type 2 cells","KE 1499","Na&iuml;ve CD4+ T cells differentiate into four types of T helper (Th) cells &ndash; Th1, Th2, Th17 and inducible regulatory T cells following exposure to infectious agents. The differentiation process begins when antigen presenting cells (APCs) come in contact with toxic substances and is mainly driven by cytokines that make up the microenvironment. For example, increased concentrations of Interleukin (IL)-12 secreted by APCs in the environment may be biased towards Th1 type and increased IL-6 or IL-4 in the environment may commit to Th2 type differentiation. Th1 cytokines, Interferon gamma (IFN-&gamma;) and IL-12 induce inflammation, aid in clearance of toxic substances, induce tissue damage and control the fibrotic responses. IFN-&gamma; has suppressive effects on the production of extracellular matrix proteins including collagen and fibronectin. The Th2 response suppresses Th1 mediated response, which results in decreased Th1 cell-mediated tissue damage but at the same time contributing to the persistence of toxic substances leading to perpetuation of tissue damage, triggering uncontrolled healing response. The major sources of Th2 cytokines are Th2 cells themselves; however, mast cells, macrophages, epithelial cells and activated fibroblasts have shown to produce IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10 upon appropriate stimulation. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 regulate wound healing.

Literature evidence for its perturbation in the context of pulmonary fibrosis:

For fibroplasia or fibrosis, the type of CD4+ T cell response that develops is crucial. Studies conducted in mice that do not express Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 show complete attenuation of fibrosis despite the highly active Th1 response. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are elevated in fibrotic lungs; IL-13 activates Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&beta;1) and initiates fibroblast proliferation and differentiation in lung fibrosis (Lee et al., 2001). Overexpression of IL-13 induces sub-epithelial airway fibrosis in mice in the absence of any other external pro-inflammatory or pro-fibrotic stimulus (Zhu et al., 1999). Both multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes induce elevated expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mouse lungs (Park et al., 2011), and increased levels of IL-25 and IL- 33 in BALF and mouse lungs exposed to MWCNTs (Dong and Ma, 2018). In a rare human study, increased levels IL-4 and IL-5 were observed in the sputum of humans exposed to MWCNTs at an occupational setting (Fatkhutdinova et al., 2016). Overexpression of IL-10 increases IL-4 and IL-13 production and lung fibrosis following exposure to silica (Barbarin et al., 2005). Alveolar macrophages from asbestosis patients (a form of lung fibrosis) exhibit M2 phenotype (He et al., 2013). Ex vivo culture of alveolar macrophages obtained from BALF of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with collagen type I showed enhanced levels of M2 macrophage markers C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-18, CCL-2 and CD204 (Stahl et al., 2013). Th2 response associated expression of IL-33 cytokine enhances polarisation of M2 macrophages and inducing M2-mediated expression of IL-13 and TGF-&beta;1 in mice (Dong and Ma, 2018). Cigarette smoke induces expression of genes associated with M2 sub-phenotypes, which is further enhanced in smokers presenting with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Shaykhiev et al., 2009)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1500","Increased, fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation","KE 1500","Fibroblasts are non-hematopoietic, non-epithelial and non-endothelial cells. In steady state conditions, they are distributed throughout the mesenchyme. During the wound healing process, fibroblasts are rapidly recruited from mesenchymal cells or in case of exaggerated repair, and they can also be derived from fibrocytes in the bone marrow. They are not terminally differentiated. They synthesise structural proteins (fibrous collagen, elastin), adhesive proteins (laminin and fibronectins) and ground substance (glycosaminoglycans &ndash; hyaluronan and glycoproteins) proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that provide structural support to tissue architecture and function. Fibroblasts play an important role in ECM maintenance and turnover, wound healing, inflammation and angiogenesis. They provide structural integrity to the newly formed wound. Fibroblasts with Alpha smooth muscle actin (&alpha;-SMA) expression are called myofibroblasts. It is thought that differentiating fibroblasts residing in the lung are the primary source of myofibroblast (CD45 Col I &alpha;-SMA) cells (Hashimoto et al., 2001; Serini and Gabbiani, 1999). Myofibroblasts can also originate from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Kim et al., 2006). The other sources of fibroblasts include fibrocytes that likely originate in the bone marrow and migrate to the site of injury upon cytokine signaling. Fibrocytes are capable of differentiating into fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, and comprise less than 1% of the circulating pool of leukocytes and express chemokines C-C motif chemokine receptor (CCR)2, C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR)4 and CCR7 in addition to a characteristic pattern of biomarkers, including collagen I and III, CD34, CD43 and CD45 (Abe et al., 2001; Bucala et al., 1994; Chesney et al., 1998). In bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, human CD34 CD45 collagen I CXCR4 cells (fibrocytes) are shown to migrate to the lungs in response to both bleomycin and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)12 (which is the only chemokine known to bind to CXCR4) (Phillips et al., 2004). Myofibroblasts exhibit features of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. The myofibroblasts synthesise and deposit ECM components that eventually replace the provisional ECM. Because of their contractile properties, they play a major role in contraction and closure of the wound tissue. Apart from secreting ECM components, myofibroblasts also secrete proteolytic enzymes such as metalloproteinases and their inhibitors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, which play a role in the final phase of the wound healing which is scar formation phase or tissue remodelling.

Literature evidence for its perturbation in the context of pulmonary fibrosis:

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterised by progressive fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation and excessive deposition of ECM (Kuhn and McDonald., 1991). High levels of &alpha; -SMA protein and increased number of &alpha;-SMA positive cells were observed in mouse lungs treated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as early as day 1 post-exposure (Dong and Ma, 2016). Fibrotic lesions observed in mice treated with asbestos show proliferating fibroblasts and collagen deposition. The same study also demonstrated that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid supernatant derived from asbestos exposed lungs was sufficient to stimulate fibroblast proliferation in vitro (Lemaire et al., 1986). Fibrotic foci developed in rat lungs following exposure to bleomycin show &alpha;-SMA expressing myofibroblasts (Vyalov et al., 1993). Several in vitro studies have shown fibroblast proliferation following carbon nanotube treatment (Hussain et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2010b)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1501","Increased, extracellular matrix deposition","KE 1501","ECM is a macromolecular structure that provides physical support to tissues and is essential for organ function. The composition of ECM is tissue specific and consists mainly of fibrous proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. The ECM in lung is compartmentalised to basement membrane and the interstitial space. Fibroblasts found in the interstitial space are the main sources of ECM in lung (White, 2015). Altered composition of ECM is observed in several lung diseases of inflammatory origin in humans including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and idiopathic lung fibrosis. The composition and architecture of the ECM determines 1) the open sites of attachment that are available to cells, 2) the mechanical properties of the ECM and 3) the mechanical loading (breathing) experienced by the cells. Thus, changes in the ECM composition during the exaggerated wound healing process determines if an organism commits to fibrotic process or completes the wound healing (Blaauboer et al., 2014).

Evidence for its perturbation in the context of pulmonary fibrosis:

In lung fibrosis, an exaggerated amount of ECM is distributed in the alveolar parenchyma in a non-heterogenous manner, leading to lower spirometry readings implying occlusion of alveolar regions and reduced gas exchange. Collagen 1 and Collagen III are suggested to be the main components of the ECM in the thickened alveolar septa in fibrosis with other constituents such as fibronectin, elastin and tenacin C (Zhang et al., 1994; Hinz, 2006; Kuhn &amp; McDonald, 1991; Crabb et al., 2006; Bensadoun et al., 1996; Klingberg et al., 2012; McKleroy et al., 2013). It is suggested that ECM composition dramatically changes during the fibrotic process. The early fibrotic process is characterised by collagen III deposition and collagen 1 predominates the later stages of the fibrosis. Excessive collagen production by myofibroblasts is necessary for the development of fibrosis (scarred tissue), with established areas of scar formation containing almost exclusively Type I collagen (Bateman et al., 1981; McKleroy et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 1994). Studies have demonstrated that while total collagen increases in IPF, there is also a shift toward the less elastic type I collagen, which contributes to the stiffness of the scar tissue within the lung (Nimni, 1983; Rozin et al., 2005; McKleroy et al., 2013).

The fibrotic ECM contains characteristic accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, which are the major contributors of ECM synthesised. The proliferation of fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts is, in turn, guided by the composition and structure of the ECM. For example, studies have demonstrated that cytokines secreted in response to inflammation are capable of activating fibroblasts, and that these changes could cause alterations in the fibroblasts that lead to excessive proliferation and ECM deposition (Sivakumar et al., 2012; Wynn, 2011)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1502","Histone deacetylase inhibition","KE 1502","Nucleosomes consist of eight core histones, two of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 [Damaskos et al., 2017]. DNA strands (about 200 bp) wind around the core histones, which can be modified on their N-terminal ends. One possible modification is the acetylation of lysine residues, which decreases the binding strength between DNA and the core histone. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) hydrolyze the acetyl residues [Damaskos et al., 2017]. HDACs remove the acetyl groups from the lysine residues leading to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally silenced chromatin. Thus, the inhibition of HDAC blocks this action and can result in hyperacetylation of histones associated mostly with increases in transcriptional activation. Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) inhibits HDAC, causing increased acetylation of the histones and thereby facilitating binding of transcription factors [Taunton et al., 1996].

It is known that eukaryotic HDAC isoforms are classified into four classes: class I HDACs (isoforms 1, 2, 3, 8), class II HDACs (isoforms 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), class III HDACs (the sirtuins), and HDAC11 [Gregoretti et al., 2004; Weichert, 2009; Barneda-Zahonero and Parra, 2012]. HDACs 1, 2, and 3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas HDAC8 is predominantly expressed in cells with smooth muscle/myoepithelial differentiation [Weichert, 2009]. HDAC6 is not observed to be expressed in lymphocytes, stromal cells, and vascular endothelial cells [Weichert, 2009]. Class III HDACs, sirtuins, are widely expressed and localized in different cellular compartments [Barneda-Zahonero and Parra, 2012]. SirT1 is highly expressed in testis, thymus, and multiple types of germ cells [Bell et al., 2014]. HDAC11 expression is enriched in the kidney, brain, testis, heart, and skeletal muscle [Barneda-Zahonero and Parra, 2012]. The members of classes 1, 2, and 4 are dependent on a zinc ion and a water molecule at their active sites, for their deacetylase function. The Sirtuins of class 3 depend on NAD+ and are considered impervious to most known HDAC inhibitors [Drummond et al., 2005].

Several structurally distinct groups of compounds have been found to inhibit HDACs of class 1, 2, and 4, among others short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate and VPA), hydroxamic acids (e.g. TSA and SAHA), and epoxyketones (e.g. Trapoxin) [Drummond et al., 2005]. The hydroxamic acids seem to exert their inhibitory action by mimicking the acetyl-lysine target of HDACs, chelating the zinc ion in the active site, and displacing the water molecule [Finnin et al., 1999]. Several high-resolution crystal structures support this mode of inhibition [Decroos et al., 2015; Luckhurst et al., 2016]. The mode of inhibition of epoxyketones seems to function in the formation of a stable transition state analog with the zinc ion in the active site [Porter and Christianson, 2017]. The inhibitory actions of the short-chain fatty acids are less well defined, but it has been speculated that VPA blocks access to the binding pocket [G&ouml;ttlicher et al., 2001]. It has been shown that VPA exerts similar gene regulatory effects to TSA, on a panel of migration-related transcripts in neural crest cells [Dreser et al., 2015], supporting a mode of action similar to hydroxamic-acid type HDAC inhibitors. Some in silico methods including molecular modeling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics are used to find the common HDAC inhibitor structures [Huang et al., 2016; Yanuar et al. 2016]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1503","Histone acetylation, increase","KE 1503","Gene transcription is regulated with the balance between acetylation and deacetylation. A dynamic balance of histone acetylation and histone deacetylation is typically catalyzed by enzymes with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and HDAC activities. Histone acetylation relaxes chromatin and makes it accessible to transcription factors, whereas deacetylation is associated with gene silencing. The balance can be disturbed also by targeting HAT, not only HDACs. At least theoretically, an activation of HAT might lead to an increase in histone acetylation. The acetylation and deacetylation are modulated on the NH3+ groups of lysine amino acid residues in histones. HDAC inhibition promotes hyperacetylation by inhibiting the deacetylation of histones with classes of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 in nucleosomes. [Wade et al., 2008]. The inhibition of HDACs results in an accumulation of acetylated proteins such as tubulin or histones."

The spermatogenic stages in which the toxicity of MAA is induced are on the patchytene spermatocytes immediately before and during meiotic division, which are Stages XII-XIV of the cycle in the rat and the early pachytene spermatocytes at stages I-IV of the cycle.

The level of CYP2E1 in the brain of a rat is significantly low, only 25% of what is found in rat liver cells. Inside a brain cell of a rat the highest level of CYP2E1 is found in the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. In human brain samples expression of CYP2E1 was found in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. CYP2E1 is also known to activate toxic related compounds (see stressors). Another important consideration is that CYP2E1 is part of the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system. When CYP2E1 is stimulated at constant rate the concentration of the enzyme in the cell will rise.

The folding of these proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum is a precise mechanism, however the folding capacity is limited. Building block for the folding of the proteins are chaperones and foldases. Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum starts when the demand for protein folding increases over the protein folding capacity. Another factor is the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum which can cause stress. The stress leads to the activation of the UPR. Three effectors are released: ATF6, IRE1 and PERK. During the release chaperone BiP (GRP78) is removed from the effectors which maintain them in inactive state. The role of the unfolded protein response is to maintain the protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Examples of proteins which are involved in apoptosis are the proteins p53, Bcl-2, JNK, and several caspases.

insecticides that act on the cuticle, particularly acylureas. The symptoms of
poisoning with diflubenzuron (DFB) and other acylureas are consistent with
ultra‐structural and biochemical evidence that these insecticides inhibit the
formation of chitin microfibrils in newly synthesised cuticle. It is probable
that DFB acts at a late stage in chitin biosynthesis, perhaps inhibiting chitin
synthase (CS) itself. However, the results of studies using cell‐free
preparations of CS have not, on the whole, supported this hypothesis. A number
of alternative suggestions as to the mode of action of DFB are reviewed. Among
the most attractive of these is the possibility that DFB may inhibit the
transmembrane transport of chitin synthesis precursors from their site of
production within the epidermal cells to the site of the final poly

chapter highlights some of the recent and important findings obtained from
studies conducted on the synthesis, structure, physical state, modification,
organization, and degradation of chitin in insect tissues, as well as the
interplay of chitin with chitin-binding proteins, the regulation of genes
responsible for chitin metabolism, and, finally, the targeting of chitin
metabolism for insect-control purposes. Chitin is the major polysaccharide
present in insects and many other invertebrates as well as in several microbes,
including fungi. It serves as the skeletal polysaccharide of several animal
phyla, such as the Arthropoda, Annelida, Molluska, and Coelenterata. In several
groups of fungi, chitin replaces cellulose as the structural polysaccharide. In
insects, it is found in the body wall or cuticle, gut lining or peritrophic
matrix (PM), salivary gland, trachea, eggshells, and muscle attachment points.
In the course of evolution, insects have made excellent use of the rigidity and
chemical stability of the polymeric chitin to assemble both hard and soft
extracellular structures such as the cuticle (exoskeleton) and PM respectively,
both of which enable insects to be protected from the environment while
allowing for growth, mobility, respiration, and communication. All of these
structures are primarily composites of chitin fibers and proteins with varying
degrees of hydration and trace materials distributed along the structures. ©

nearly all adult insects fly, the cuticle has to provide a very efficient and
lightweight skeleton. Information is available about the mechanical properties
of cuticle - Young's modulus of resilin is about 1 MPa, of soft cuticles about
1kPa to 50 MPa, of sclerotised cuticles 1-20 GPa; Vicker's Hardness of
sclerotised cuticle ranges between 25 and 80kgfmm-2; density is 1-1.3 kg m-3 -
and one of its components, chitin nanofibres, the Young's modulus of which is
more than 150 GPa. Experiments based on fracture mechanics have not been
performed although the layered structure probably provides some toughening. The
structural performance of wings and legs has been measured, but our
understanding of the importance of buckling is lacking: it can stiffen the
structure (by elastic postbuckling in wings, for example) or be a failure mode.
We know nothing of fatigue properties (yet, for instance, the insect wing must
undergo millions of cycles, flexing or buckling on each cycle). The remarkable
mechanical performance and efficiency of cuticle can be analysed and compared
with those of other materials using material property charts and material
indices. Presented in this paper are four: Young's modulus - density (stiffness
per unit weight), specific Young's modulus - specific strength (elastic hinges,
elastic energy storage per unit weight), toughness - Young's modulus (fracture
resistance under various loading conditions), and hardness (wear resistance).
In conjunction with a structural analysis of cuticle these charts help to
understand the relevance of microstructure (fibre orientation effects in
tendons, joints and sense organs, for example) and shape (including surface
structure) of this fibrous composite for a given function. With modern
techniques for analysis of structure and material, and emphasis on
nanocomposites and self-assembly, insect cuticle should be the archetype for

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1528","Fatty Acid Beta Oxidation, Decreased","KE 1528","PPAR&alpha; acts as a positive transcriptional regulator for many of the genes involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation as well as genes involved in the pre- and post-processing of fatty acids in peroxisomal pathways (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014).  Thus, decreased PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling results in decreased transcriptional expression of genes that are regulated by PPAR&alpha;, and subsequently, decreased expression of the coded proteins and enzymes that ultimately decreased fatty acid metabolism within peroxisomes and mitochondria.  In PPAR&alpha; knock-out mice, fatty acid oxidation capacity was decreased in well fed, rested mice and the reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity was greatly exacerbated during exercise challenge or 24h starvation (Muoio et al 2002).

 

Genes Involved:  The first gene target identified for PPAR&alpha; was Acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1, Dreyer et al 1992) which represents the first enzyme in peroxisomal long-chain fatty acid oxidation (Kersten 2014) and is also the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway (Desvergne and Wahili 1999).  In addition to Acox1, a variety of additional enzymes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism are under transcriptional control of PPAR&alpha; transactivation including enzymes that facilitate fatty acid uptake into the peroxisome (Abcd1, Abcd2 and Abcd 3), conversion of acyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA to acyl-carnitine/acetyl-carnitine (Crot/Crat), and conversion of acyl-CoAs back to fatty acids via thioesterases (Acots, as reviewed in Kersten 2014).  PPARalpha also has transcriptional control over enzymes downstream of Acox1 in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of acyl-CoA pathway including L-bifunctional enzyme (Ehhadh), D-bifunctional enzyme (Hsd17b4), and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity (Acaa1a, Acaa1b, as reviewed in Kersten 2014).  All of these genes are potential targets for screening affects within this KE.

 

As reviewed in Kersten (2014), the genes (and associated functions) regulated by PPAR&alpha; in the mitochondrial processing of fatty acids include the following:  (1) Import of acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria is facilitated by PPAR&alpha;-induced increases in expression of carnitine palmitoyl-transferases 1a, 1b, and 1 (Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2) and acyl-carnitine translocase (Slc25a20; Brandt et al 1998, Mascaro et al 1998, Feige et al 2010).  (2) The first step of mitochondrial beta-oxidation is catalyzed by length-specific acyl-CoA hydrogenases (Acadvl, Acadl, Acadm, Acads; Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994).  (3) The three subsequent steps in mitochondrial beta-oxidation that successively release acetyl-CoAs from the hydrocarbon chain are catalyzed by the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (Hadha and Hadhb).  These enzymes are replaced upon progressive chain shortening by Hadh and Acaa2.  (4) the final PPARalpha targets include Eci1, Eci2, Decr1, and Hsd17b10 which convert unsaturated and 2-methlylated aclyl-CoAs into intermediates of beta-oxidation (Sanderson et al 2008, Aoyama et al 1998). 

 

 

Metabolism Affected:  Peroxisomes participate in a variety of lipid metabolic pathways including the beta-oxidation of very long-straight chain (&lt;20 C in length) or branched &ndash;chain acyl-CoAs (Lazarow 1978, Kersten 2014).  The peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway is not directly coupled to the electron transport chain and oxidative phosporylation, therefore the first oxidation reaction transforms energy to heat (H2O2 production) while in the second step, energy is captured in the metabolically accessible form of high-energy electrons in NADH (Mannaerts and Van Veldhoven 1993, Desvergne and Wahli 1999).  The peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway provides fatty acid chain shortening where two carbons are removed in each round of oxidation in the form of acetyl-CoA (Desvergne and Wahli 1999).  The acetyl-CoA monomers serve as fundamental units for metabolic energy production (ATP)  via the citric acid cycle followed by electron-transport chain mediated oxidative phosphorylation (Nelson and Cox, 2000A) as well as serve as the fundamental units for energy storage via gluconeogenesis (Nelson and Cox, 2000B) and lipogenesis (Nelson and Cox, 2000C).  The shortened chain fatty acids (&lt;20C) can then be transported to the mitochondria to undergo mitochondrial beta-oxidation for complete metabolism of the carbon substrate for cellular energy production (Desvergne and Wahli 1999).

 

Mitochondrial processing of fatty acids involves:  (1) Import of short, medium and long chain fatty acids (&lt;C20) acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyl-transferases 1a, 1b, and 1 (Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2) and acyl-carnitine translocase (Slc25a20, Brandt et al 1998; Mascaro et al 1998, Kersten et al 2014).  (2) The first step of beta-oxidation catalyzed by the length-specific acyl-CoA hydrogenases (Acadvl, Acadl, Acadm, Acads; Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994, Kersten et al 2014).  (3) The three subsequent steps in mitochondrial beta-oxidation that successively release acetyl-CoAs from the hydrocarbon chain are catalyzed by the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (Hadha and Hadhb, Kersten et al 2014).  These enzymes are replaced upon progressive chain shortening by Hadh and Acaa2 (Kersten et al 2014).  (4) The conversion of unsaturated and 2-methylated acetyl-CoAs into intermediates of beta-oxidation are catalyzed by Eci1, Eci2, Decr1, and Hsd17b10 (Sanderson et al 2008, Aoyama et al 1998, Kersten et al 2014).  Interestingly, tissue-specific differences in sensitivity to PPAR&alpha; knock out have been observed in mice where fatty acid oxidation was markedly impaired in liver and heart tissues whereas skeletal muscle was largely unaffected due to seven-fold increased abundance of PPAR&delta; in skeletal muscle tissue (Muoio et al 2007).  Redundancy in regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism across PPAR&alpha;, PPAR&beta;, PPAR&delta;, and PPAR&gamma; are known in canonical signaling pathways (KEGG Pathway map03320) where metabolic responses are coordinated across the iso-types with whole-organism-level effects on insulin sensitivity, body fat, and body weight (Harrington et al 2007)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1538","Decreased protection against oxidative stress","KE 1538","High levels reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be very damaging to cells and molecules within the cell.  As a result, the cell has important defense mechanisms to protect itself from ROS, such as glutathione and selenoenzymes.

 

Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant low molecular mass thiol compound synthesized in cells, reaching intracellular concentrations of 1&ndash;10 mM, and is the major antioxidant and redox buffer in human cells. In fact, GSH serves as a reducing agent for ROS and other unstable molecules generated by catalytic systems, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx)(Forman, 2009).

 

Selenium plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense, as one Se atom is absolutely required at the active site of all selenoenzymes, such as GPx and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), in the form of selenocystein (Rayman, 2000). GPx is an antioxidant enzyme that, in the presence of tripeptide GSH, adds two electrons to reduce H2O2 and lipid peroxides to water and lipid alcohols, respectively, while simultaneously oxidizing GSH to glutathione disulfide. The GPx/GSH system is thought to be a major defense in low-level oxidative stress, and decreased GPx activity or GSH levels may lead to the absence of adequate H2O2 and lipid peroxides detoxification, which may be converted to OH-radicals and lipid peroxyl radicals, respectively, by transition metals (Fe2+) (Brigelius-Flohe, 2013). Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is essential for maintaining intracellular redox status. The expression of this small (12 kDa) ubiquitous thiol-active protein is induced by ROS and an elevated serum level may indicate a state of oxidative stress. In this regard, TrxR, a NADPH-dependent lipid hydroperoxide reductase, uses NADPH to maintain the levels of reduced Trx via a mechanism similar to that used by GR to maintain GSH levels, contributing to the maintenance of thiol redox homeostasis in proteins. Importantly, the inhibition of TrxR impairs the cyclical regeneration of Trx activity, as Trx remains in the oxidized state (Bjornstedt, 1995, Zhong, 2002). Other, less studied selenoproteins, such as SelP, H, K, S, R, and W selenoproteins, play a role in antioxidant defense (Pisoschi, 2015, Reeves, 2009)"

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/155","Inadequate DNA repair","KE 155","DNA lesions may result from the formation of DNA adducts (i.e., covalent modification of DNA by chemicals), or by the action of agents such as radiation that may produce strand breaks or modified nucleotides within the DNA molecule. These DNA lesions are repaired through several mechanistically distinct pathways that can be categorized as follows:


	Damage reversal acts to reverse the damage without breaking any bonds within the sugar phosphate backbone of the DNA. The most prominent enzymes associated with damage reversal are photolyases (Sancar, 2003) that can repair UV dimers in some organisms, and O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) (Pegg 2011) and oxidative demethylases (Sundheim et al., 2008), which can repair some types of alkylated bases.
	Excision repair involves the removal of a damaged nucleotide(s) through cleavage of the sugar phosphate backbone followed by re-synthesis of DNA within the resultant gap. Excision repair of DNA lesions can be mechanistically divided into: 
	a) Base excision repair (BER) (Dianov and H&uuml;bscher, 2013), in which the damaged base is removed by a damage-specific glycosylase prior to incision of the phosphodiester backbone at the resulting abasic site. This leads to an intermediate that contains a DNA strand break, whereby DNA ligase is then recruited to seal the ends of the DNA.

	b) Nucleotide excision repair (NER) (Sch&auml;rer, 2013), in which the DNA strand containing the damaged nucleotide is incised at sites several nucleotides 5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; to the site of damage, and a polynucleotide containing the damaged nucleotide is removed prior to DNA resynthesis within the resultant gap and sealing of the ends by DNA ligase.  

	c) Mismatch repair (MMR) (Li et al., 2016)  which does not act on DNA lesions but does recognize mispaired bases resulting from replication errors. In MMR the strand containing the misincorporated base is removed prior to DNA resynthesis.

	The major pathway that removes oxidative DNA damage is base excision repair (BER), which can be either monofunctional or bifunctional; in mammals, a specific DNA glycosylase (OGG1: 8-Oxoguanine glycosylase) is responsible for excision of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and other oxidative lesions (Hu et al., 2005; Scott et al., 2014; Whitaker et al., 2017). We note that long-patch BER is used for the repair of clustered oxidative lesions, which uses several enzymes from DNA replication pathways (Klungland and Lindahl, 1997). These pathways are described in detail in various reviews e.g., (Whitaker et al., 2017). 
	
	Single strand break repair (SSBR) involves different proteins and enzymes depending on the origin of the SSB (e.g., produced as an intermediate in excision repair or due to direct chemical insult) but the same general steps of repair are taken for all SSBs: detection, DNA end processing, synthesis, and ligation (Caldecott, 2014). Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase1 (PARP1) detects and binds unscheduled SSBs (i.e., not deliberately induced during excision repair) and synthesizes PAR as a signal to the downstream factors in repair. PARP1 is not required to initiate SSBR of BER intermediates. The XRCC1 protein complex is then recruited to the site of damage where a common DNA intermediate as BER was generated, and acts as a scaffold for proteins and enzymes required for repair. Depending on the nature of the damaged termini of the DNA strand, different enzymes are required for end processing to generate the substrates that DNA polymerase &beta; (Pol&beta;; short patch repair) or Pol &delta;/&epsilon; (long patch repair) can bind to synthesize over the gap, although end processing is generally done by polynucleotide kinase. Synthesis in long-patch repair displaces a single stranded flap which is excised by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). In short-patch repair, the XRCC1/Lig3&alpha; complex joins the two ends after synthesis. In long-patch repair, the PCNA/Lig1 complex ligates the ends. (Caldecott, 2014). 
	Double strand break repair (DSBR) is necessary to preserve genomic integrity when breaks occur in both strands of a DNA molecule. There are two major pathways for DSBR: homologous recombination (HR), which operates primarily during the S phase of dividing cell types, and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which can function in both dividing and non-dividing cell types. No repair occurs in the M phase (Teruaki Iyama and David M. Wilson III, 2013). DNA repair in mitosis is controversial (Mladenov et al., 2023).


Complex lesions can be created by a single mutagen and can be more difficult to repair, as the mechanism behind how different repair pathways cooperate to address this is still unclear (Aleksandrov et al., 2018). In higher eukaryotes such as mammals, NHEJ is usually the preferred pathway for DNA DSBR. Its use, however, is dependent on the cell type, the gene locus, and the nuclease platform (Miyaoka et al., 2016). The use of NHEJ is also dependent on the cell cycle; NHEJ is generally not the pathway of choice when the cell is in the late S or G2 phase of the cell cycle, or in mitotic cells when the sister chromatid is directly adjacent to the double-strand break (DSB) (Lieber et al., 2003). In these cases, the HR pathway is commonly used for repair of DSBs. Despite this, NHEJ is still used more commonly than HR in human cells. Classical NHEJ (C-NHEJ) is the most common NHEJ repair mechanism, but alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ) can also occur, especially in the absence of C-NHEJ and HR.

The process of C-NHEJ in humans requires at least seven core proteins: Ku70, Ku86, DNA-dependent protein kinase complex (DNA-PKcs ), Artemis, X-ray cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), XRCC4-like factor (XLF), and DNA ligase IV (Boboila et al., 2012). When DSBs occur, the Ku proteins, which have a high affinity for DNA ends, will bind to the break site and form a heterodimer. This protects the DNA from exonucleolytic attack and acts to recruit DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit, thus forming a trimeric complex on the ends of the DNA strands. Alternative NHEJ, or alt NHEJ, uses small similar sequences in two broken DNA ends to join them together. Unlike the usual repair method (cNHEJ), aNHEJ doesn&#39;t need specific proteins like LIG4 and KU. Instead, it relies on the MRN complex to process the breaks. However, alt NHEJ tends to cause mutations by adding or removing bits of DNA during the repair (Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017). The kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is then triggered, causing DNA-PKcs to auto-phosphorylate and thereby lose its kinase activity; the now phosphorylated DNA-PKcs dissociates from the DNA-bound Ku proteins. The free DNA-PKcs phosphorylates Artemis, an enzyme that possesses 5&rsquo;-3&rsquo; exonuclease and endonuclease activity in the presence of DNA-PKcs and ATP. Artemis is responsible for &lsquo;cleaning up&rsquo; the ends of the DNA. For 5&rsquo; overhangs, Artemis nicks the overhang, generally leaving a blunt duplex end. For 3&rsquo; overhangs, Artemis will often leave a four- or five-nucleotide single stranded overhang (Pardo et al., 2009; Fattah et al., 2010; Lieber et al., 2010). Next, the XLF and XRCC4 proteins form a complex which makes a channel to bind DNA and aligns the ends for efficient ligation via DNA ligase IV (Hammel et al., 2011).

The process of alt-NHEJ is less well understood than C-NHEJ and is a lower fidelity mechanism.  Alt-NHEJ is known to involve slightly different core proteins than C-NHEJ and required microhomology repeats, but the steps of the pathway are essentially the same between the two processes (reviewed in Chiruvella et al., 2013). It is established, however, that alt-NHEJ is more error-prone in nature than C-NHEJ, which contributes to incorrect DNA repair. Alt-NHEJ is thus considered primarily to be a backup repair mechanism (reviewed in Chiruvella et al., 2013). 

In contrast to NHEJ, HR takes advantage of similar or identical DNA sequences to repair DSBs and is not error-prone (Sung and Klein, 2006). The initiating step of HR is the creation of a 3&rsquo; single strand DNA (ss-DNA) overhang. Combinases such as RecA and Rad51 then bind to the ss-DNA overhang, and other accessory factors, including Rad54, help recognize and invade the homologous region on another DNA strand. From there, DNA polymerases are able to elongate the 3&rsquo; invading single strand and resynthesize the broken DNA strand using the corresponding sequence on the homologous strand.

 

Fidelity of DNA Repair


Most DNA repair pathways are extremely efficient. However, in principal, all DNA repair pathways can be overwhelmed when the DNA lesion burden exceeds the capacity of a given DNA repair pathway to recognize and remove the lesion. Exceeded repair capacity may lead to toxicity or mutagenesis following DNA damage. Apart from extremely high DNA lesion burden, inadequate repair may arise through several different specific mechanisms. For example, during repair of DNA containing O6-alkylguanine adducts, AGT irreversibly binds a single O6-alkylguanine lesion and as a result is inactivated (this is termed suicide inactivation, as its own action causes it to become inactivated). Thus, the capacity of AGT to carry out alkylation repair can become rapidly saturated when the DNA repair rate exceeds the de novo synthesis of AGT (Pegg, 2011).

A second mechanism relates to cell specific differences in the cellular levels or activity of some DNA repair proteins. For example, XPA is an essential component of the NER complex. The level of XPA that is active in NER is low in the testes, which may reduce the efficiency of NER in testes as compared to other tissues (K&ouml;berle et al., 1999). Likewise, both NER and BER have been reported to be deficient in cells lacking functional p53 (Adimoolam and Ford, 2003; Hanawalt et al., 2003; Seo and Jung, 2004). A third mechanism relates to the importance of the DNA sequence context of a lesion in its recognition by DNA repair enzymes. For example, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is repaired primarily by BER; the lesion is initially acted upon by a bifunctional glycosylase, OGG1, which carries out the initial damage recognition and excision steps of 8-oxoG repair. However, the rate of excision of 8-oxoG is modulated strongly by both chromatin components (Menoni et al., 2012) and DNA sequence context (Allgayer et al., 2013) leading to significant differences in the repair of lesions situated in different chromosomal locations.

DNA repair is also remarkably error-free. However, misrepair can arise during repair under some circumstances. DSBR is notably error prone, particularly when breaks are processed through NHEJ, during which partial loss of genome information is common at the site of the double strand break (Iyama and Wilson, 2013). This is because NHEJ rejoins broken DNA ends without the use of extensive homology; instead, it uses the microhomology present between the two ends of the DNA strand break to ligate the strand back into one. When the overhangs are not compatible, however, indels (insertion or deletion events), duplications, translocations, and inversions in the DNA can occur. These changes in the DNA may lead to significant issues within the cell, including alterations in the gene determinants for cellular fatality (Moore et al., 1996).

Activation of mutagenic DNA repair pathways to withstand cellular or replication stress either from endogenous or exogenous sources can promote cellular viability, albeit at a cost of increased genome instability and mutagenesis (Fitzgerald et al., 2017). These salvage DNA repair pathways including, Break-induced Replication (BIR) and Microhomology-mediated Break-induced Replication (MMBIR). BIR repairs one-ended DSBs and has been extensively studied in yeast as well as in mammalian systems. BIR and MMBIR are linked with heightened levels of mutagenesis, chromosomal rearrangements and ensuing genome instability (Deem et al., 2011; Sakofsky et al., 2015; Saini et al., 2017; Kramara et al., 2018). In mammalian genomes BIR-like synthesis has been proposed to be involved in late stage Mitotic DNA Synthesis (MiDAS) that predominantly occurs at so-called Common Fragile Sites (CFSs) and maintains telomere length under s conditions of replication stress that serve to promote cell viability (Minocherhomji et al., 2015; Bhowmick et al., 2016; Dilley et al., 2016).       

Misrepair may also occur through other repair pathways. Excision repair pathways require the resynthesis of DNA and rare DNA polymerase errors during gap resynthesis will result in mutations (Brown et al., 2011). Errors may also arise during gap resynthesis when the strand that is being used as a template for DNA synthesis contains DNA lesions (Kozmin and Jinks-Robertson, 2013). In addition, it has been shown that sequences that contain tandemly repeated sequences, such as CAG triplet repeats, are subject to expansion during gap resynthesis that occurs during BER of 8-oxoG damage (Liu et al., 2009)."

The differential regulation of a panel of such genes, has been investigated in an in vitro system, which found that histone deacetylases VPA, TSA, and SAHA exerted similar gene regulatory profiles which were quite distinct from those of other compounds shown to affect NCC migration in a scratch assay (Dreser et al., 2015). A similar experimental setup has applied a broader Affymetrix chip approach to identify biomarkers specific to the inhibition of NCC migration (Pallocca et al., 2016). In vivo evidence for the importance of specific HDACs to NCC migration has been provided by genetic knock down experiments in zebrafish embryos (DeLaurier et al., 2012).

It is likely that the NCC migratory inhibition exerted by HDAC inhibitors is, at least in part, due to the broad transcriptomic impact of HDAC action on histones. However, it cannot be excluded HDAC inhibition could, to some degree, be effects altered acetylation patterns on other proteins, e.g. tubulin acetylation has been shown to be affected by HDAC activity (Hubbert et al., 2002)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1602","Activation, Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors","KE 1602","Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with five different subtypes (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5). GPCRs are transmembrane receptors that detect extracellular signals and activate internal pathways which modulate a variety of processes such as locomotion, learning and memory, thermoregulation and epileptic seizures (Gainetdinov and Caron, 1999).  Subtypes M1, M3, and M5 are Gq- coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C enzyme resulting in two secondary messengers, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Subtypes M2 and M4 are inhibitory and signal using the Gi pathway (Haga, 2013). Gi protein activation inhibits adenylyl cyclase, and reduces the conversion of ATP to cAMP (Jett and Lein, 2011).

           In its resting state, the mAChR G-protein subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) are clustered together and the alpha subunit is bound to GDP.  Once a ligand binds to an mAChR, the receptor undergoes a conformation change that allows the alpha subunit to exchange its bound GDP with GTP, then the alpha subunit dissociates from the beta and gamma subunits. Once the alpha subunit is free of the beta and gamma subunits, it moves along the cell membrane to affect its target enzyme, which typically sends out secondary messenger signals (Kandel et al., 2013)"

The terminal glucoses and mannoses in combination with lectin receptors maintain correct folding of nascent polypeptide and contribute in the elimination of misfolded proteins (Schwarz &amp; Aebi, 2011)(Adnan et al., 2016)(Araki &amp; Nagata, 2012)(Shao &amp; Hegde, 2016)(Kim, Spear, &amp; Ng, 2005)

This quality control of protein folding is glycosylation directed. Misfolded proteins that are unglycosylated fail to be recognized by ERAD (Shental-Bechor &amp; Levy, 2008)

Glycosylation inhibition can be achieved through direct inhibition of the biosynthesis or the processing of N-Linked oligosaccharide chains. Enzymes that synthesize N-linked oligosaccharide chain are targets for inhibition of glycosylation.

Tunicamycin inhibits N-Linked glycosylation by blocking the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-P. Amphomycin, a lipopeptide, inhibits dolichol-P-mannose synthesis by apparently forming complexes with the carrier lipid dolichol-P. (Mcdowell et al., 1988) Elbein et al 1987,Varki et al 2009)"
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1613","Decrease, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level","KE 1613","Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is an endogenous steroid hormone and a potent androgen. The level of DHT in tissue or blood is dependent on several factors, such as the synthesis, uptake/release, metabolism, and elimination from the system, which again can be dependent on biological compartment and developmental stage.

DHT is primarily synthesized from testosterone (T) via the irreversible enzymatic reaction facilitated by 5&alpha;-Reductases (5&alpha;-REDs) (Swerdloff et al., 2017). Different isoforms of this enzyme are differentially expressed in specific tissues (e.g. prostate, skin, liver, and hair follicles) at different developmental stages, and depending on disease status (Azzouni et al., 2012; Uhl&eacute;n et al., 2015), which ultimately affects the local production of DHT. 

An alternative (&ldquo;backdoor&rdquo;) pathway , exists for DHT formation that is independent of T and androstenedione as precursors. While first discovered in marsupials, the physiological importance of this pathway has now also been established in other mammals including humans (Renfree and Shaw, 2023). This pathway relies on the conversion of progesterone (P) or 17-OH-P to androsterone and then androstanediol through several enzymatic reactions and finally, the conversion of androstanediol into DHT probably by HSD17B6 (Miller &amp; Auchus, 2019; Naamneh Elzenaty et al., 2022). The &ldquo;backdoor&rdquo; synthesis pathway is a result of an interplay between placenta, adrenal gland, and liver during fetal life (Miller &amp; Auchus, 2019).

The conversion of T to DHT by 5&alpha;-RED in peripheral tissue is mainly responsible for the circulating levels of DHT, though some tissues express enzymes needed for further metabolism of DHT consequently leading to little release and contribution to circulating levels (Swerdloff et al.). 

The initial conversion of DHT into inactive steroids is primarily through 3&alpha;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3&alpha;-HSD) and 3&beta;-HSD in liver, intestine, skin, and androgen-sensitive tissues. The subsequent conjugation is mainly mediated by uridine 5&acute;-diphospho (UDP)-glucuronyltransferase 2 (UGT2) leading to biliary and urinary elimination from the system. Conjugation also occurs locally to control levels of highly potent androgens (Swerdloff et al., 2017).

Disruption of any of the aforementioned processes may lead to decreased DHT levels, either systemically or at tissue level."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1614","Decrease, androgen receptor activation","KE 1614","This KE refers to decreased activation of the androgen receptor (AR) as occurring in complex biological systems such as tissues and organs in vivo. It is thus considered distinct from KEs describing either blocking of AR or decreased androgen synthesis.

The AR is a nuclear transcription factor with canonical AR activation regulated by the binding of the androgens such as testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Thus, AR activity can be decreased by reduced levels of steroidal ligands (testosterone, DHT) or the presence of compounds interfering with ligand binding to the receptor (Davey &amp; Grossmann, 2016; Gao et al., 2005).

In the inactive state, AR is sequestered in the cytoplasm of cells by molecular chaperones. In the classical (genomic) AR signaling pathway, AR activation causes dissociation of the chaperones, AR dimerization and translocation to the nucleus to modulate gene expression. AR binds to the androgen response element (ARE) (Davey &amp; Grossmann, 2016; Gao et al., 2005). Notably, for transcriptional regulation the AR is closely associated with other co-factors that may differ between cells, tissues and life stages. In this way, the functional consequence of AR activation is cell- and tissue-specific. This dependency on co-factors such as the SRC proteins also means that stressors affecting recruitment of co-activators to AR can result in decreased AR activity (Heinlein &amp; Chang, 2002).

Ligand-bound AR may also associate with cytoplasmic and membrane-bound proteins to initiate cytoplasmic signaling pathways with other functions than the nuclear pathway. Non-genomic AR signaling includes association with Src kinase to activate MAPK/ERK signaling and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Decreased AR activity may therefore be a decrease in the genomic and/or non-genomic AR signaling pathways (Leung &amp; Sadar, 2017)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1616","Malformation, cryptorchidism - maldescended testis","KE 1616","Undescended testis is a testicular disorder syndrome known as  cryptorchidism. Testis migration is a major event in male fetus development, as it will directly affect his reproductive health.

Cryptorchidism can defined itself as the insertion of the testis in another position than the scrotum. Although the events leading to this pathology occurred during development, cryptorchidism can only be defined after birth though clinical examination as palpation.

Cryptorchidism can be either uni- or bilateral and has been reported to increase in incidence over the decades (Denmark, UK, India&hellip;). The maldescended testis will experiment heat stress (37 against 33C outside the body) interfering with testicular physiology and development of germ cells into spermatogonia. Germ cells maturation failure will induce a non-reversible reduction in fertility power of the individual. Cryptorchidism is an established risk factor for infertility and is known to increase the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) 123

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1632","Increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)","KE 1632","Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are highly reactive oxygen- and nitrogen-based molecules that often contain or generate free radicals. Key molecules include superoxide ([O2]&bull;&minus;), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical ([OH]&bull;), lipid peroxide (ROOH), nitric oxide ([NO]&bull;, and peroxynitrite ([ONOO-]) (Dickinson and Chang 2011; Egea, Fabregat et al. 2017)

RONS are generated in the course of cellular respiration, metabolism, cell signaling, and inflammation (Dickinson and Chang 2011; Egea, Fabregat et al. 2017). Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are commonly produced by the mitochondrial electron transport chain and cytochrome c and by membrane bound NADPH oxidases and related molecules. Hydrogen peroxide is also made by the endoplasmic reticulum in the course of protein folding. Nitric oxide is produced at the highest levels by nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells and phagocytes. The other species are produced by reactions with superoxide or peroxide, or by other free radicals or enzymes.

RONS activity is principally local. Most reactive oxygen species (ROS) have short half-lives, ranging from nano- to milliseconds, so diffusion is limited, while reactive nitrogen species (RNS) nitric oxide or peroxynitrate can survive long enough to diffuse across membranes (Calcerrada, Peluffo et al. 2011). Consequently, local concentrations of ROS are much higher than average cellular concentrations and signaling is typically controlled by colocalization with redox buffers (Dickinson and Chang 2011; Egea, Fabregat et al. 2017). The effects of ROS and RNS are countered by cellular antioxidants, with glutathione and peroxiredoxins playing a major role (Dickinson and Chang 2011). Glutathione is slower but broad acting, while peroxiredoxins act quickly and are specific to peroxides. Peroxiredoxins are effective at low peroxide concentrations but can be deactivated at higher concentrations, suggesting the cellular response to peroxides may sometimes be non-linear.

Although their existence is limited temporally and spatially, reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with other RONS or with other nearby molecules to produce more ROS and participate in a feedback loop to amplify the ROS signal, which can increase Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS). Both ROS and RNS also move into neighboring cells and ROS can increase intracellular RONS signaling in neighboring cells (Egea, Fabregat et al. 2017).

RONS can modify a range of targets including amino acids, lipids, and nucleic acids to inactivate or alter target functionality (Calcerrada, Peluffo et al. 2011; Dickinson and Chang 2011; Go and Jones 2013; Ravanat, Breton et al. 2014; Egea, Fabregat et al. 2017). For example, phosphatases including the tumor suppressor PTEN can be reversibly deactivated by oxidation, and the movement of HDAC4 is peroxide dependent.

Oxidative adducts form mainly on C5 and to a lesser degree on C6 of thymine and cytosine, and on C8 of guanine and adenine. Guanine is most prone to oxidation due to its low oxidation potential (Jovanovic and Simic, 1986). Indeed, 8-oxo-2&rsquo;-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG)/8-hydroxy-2&rsquo;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is the most abundant and well-studied oxidative DNA lesion in the cell (Swenberg et al., 2011). It causes an A(anti):8-oxo-G(syn) mispair instead of the normal C(anti):8-oxo-G(syn) pair. This pairing does not cause large structural changes to the DNA backbone, and therefore remains undetected by the polymerase&rsquo;s proofreading mechanism. Consequently, one of the daughter strands will have an AT pair instead of the correct GC pair after replication (Markkanen, 2017). 

Formamidopyrimidine lesions on guanine and adenine (FaPyG and FaPyA), 8-hydroxy-2&#39;-deoxyadenine (8-oxodA), and thymidine glycol (Tg) are other common oxidative lesions. We refer the reader to reviews on this topic to see the full set of potential oxidative DNA lesions (Whitaker et al., 2017). Oxidative DNA lesions are present in the cell at a steady state due to endogenous redox processes (Swenberg et al., 2010). Under normal conditions, cells are able to withstand the baseline level of oxidized bases through efficient repair and regulation of free radicals in the cell. However, direct chemical insult from specific compounds, exposure to various forms of radiation, or induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the reduction of endogenous molecules, as well as through the release of inflammatory cell-derived oxidants, can lead to increased DNA oxidation, a state known as oxidative stress (Turner et al., 2002; Schoenfeld et al., 2012; Tangvarasittichai and Tangvarasittichai, 2019). It is worth noting that ROS must be generated near the DNA to cause damage, otherwise, if ROS was produced more distantly, then it can be removed by the cell (Nilsson &amp; Liu, 2020). Furthermore, although cells do possess repair mechanisms to deal with oxidative DNA damage, sometimes the repair intermediates can interfere with genome function or decrease stability of the genome. This creates a balancing act between when it is best to repair damage and when it is best to leave it (Poetsch, 2020a). 

This KE describes an increase in oxidative lesions of a broad spectrum (ie. superoxide radical (O2&bull;&minus;), hydroxyl radical (OH), peroxyl radical (RO22), single oxygen (1O2 ) in the nuclear DNA above the steady-state level. Oxidative DNA damage can occur in any cell type with nuclear DNA under oxidative stress."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1635","Increase, DNA strand breaks","KE 1635","DNA strand breaks are a type of damage resulting from the hydrolysis of phosphodiester groups in the backbone of DNA molecules (Gates, 2009) and can occur on a single strand (single strand breaks; SSBs) or both strands (double strand breaks; DSBs). SSBs arise when the sugar phosphate backbones connecting adjacent nucleotides in DNA are simultaneously hydrolyzed such that the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are not able to hold the two strands together. DSBs are generated when both strands are simultaneously broken at sites that are sufficiently close to one another that base-pairing and chromatin structure are insufficient to keep the two DNA ends juxtaposed. As a consequence, the two DNA ends generated by a DSB can physically dissociate from one another, becoming difficult to repair and increasing the chance of inappropriate recombination with other sites in the genome (Jackson, 2002). SSB can turn into DSB if the replication fork stalls at the lesion leading to fork collapse. Strand breaks are intermediates in various biological events, including DNA repair (e.g., excision repair), as well as other normal cellular processes where DSBs act as genetic shufflers to generate genetic diversity for V(D)J recombination in lymphoid cells, and chromatin remodeling in both somatic cells and germ cells, and meiotic recombination in gametes. 

Strand breaks are intermediates in various biological events, including DNA repair (e.g., excision repair), V(D)J recombination in developing lymphoid cells and chromatin remodeling in both somatic cells and germ cells. The spectrum of damage can be complex, particularily if the stressor is from large amounts of deposited energy which can result in complex lesions and clustered damage defined as two or more oxidized bases, abasic sites or starnd breaks on opposing DNA strands within a few helical turns. These lesions are more difficult to repair and have been studied in many types of models (Barbieri et al., 2019 and Asaithamby et al., 2011). DSBs and complex lesions are of particular concern, as they are considered the most lethal and deleterious type of DNA lesion. If misrepaired or left unrepaired, DSBs may drive the cell towards genomic instability, apoptosis or tumorigenesis (Beir, 1999)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1640","Altered, Photoreceptor patterning","KE 1640","Photoreceptors in the retina of vertebrates and invertebrates are the cells that are responsible for phototransduction. The main groups of photoreceptor cells are rods, active at very low light levels, and cones, active at higher light levels and responsible for color vision. Photoreceptor subtypes are characterized by different opsins (light-sensitive proteins) that respond to light with different wavelengths.

The opsin characterizing rods is rhodopsin. Cones are further divided in several subtypes. The opsins characterizing these subtypes are generally grouped in S-opsins (short wavelength-sensitive), M-opsins (medium wavelength-sensitive) and L-opsins (long wavelength-sensitive). The occurrence of different opsins is species-specific (see Taxonomic applicability). 

The distribution of photoreceptor subtypes within the retina is also referred to as photoreceptor patterning and has a quantitative component (typical ratios of photoreceptor subtypes) as well as a spatial component (organization of photoreceptor subtypes). Depending on the species, the spatial organization is stochastic/regionalized (human, fruit fly), regionalized (mouse), or ordered (zebrafish).

During early development, photoreceptor subtypes differentiate from retinal progenitor cells. In a later stage of embryo or juvenile development, already differentiated cone photoreceptors can also switch opsin expression to a different opsin type. In general, this opsin switch is characterized by a switch in opsin expression from short to longer wavelength-sensitive opsins. An opsin switch is part of normal eye development and has been documented mostly in fish species (Shand et al., 2002; Cheng et al., 2006; Cheng and Flamarique, 2007; Matsumoto and Ishibashi, 2016; Mackin et al., 2019), and also in rodents (Lukats et al., 2005). 

Under some circumstances, photoreceptor patterning and opsin switching can be altered. This can manifest itself as altered numbers of photoreceptor subtypes leading to an altered ratio of photoreceptor subtypes and/or altered spatial organization (Raymond et al., 2014)."

GSK3b kinase is constitutively active in resting cells and undergoes a rapid and transient inhibition in response to a number of external signals.

Insight into sustained AHR activation is provided by examining the induction of ethoxyresorufin-O,O-deethylase in liver by three DLCs at three different time points (NTP, 2006a; NTP, 2006b; NTP, 2006c). Plots of the fractional or normalized ethoxyresorufin-O,O- deethylase response from three NTP cancer bioassays are shown in the plots on the left of Fig. 2. Induction of ethoxyresorufin-O,O- deethylase is easily measured and serves as a biomarker of CYP1A1 gene expression. The dose term on the x-axis is the area under the curve (AUC) of liver concentration. The normalized ethoxyresorufin-O,O-deethylase response on the y-axis is similar at 14, 31 and 53 weeks (Left column of Fig. 2). The plots for 31 weeks and 53 weeks are shifted to the right given the dose term on the x-axis is the AUC of hepatic concentration of the three chemicals, TCDD, 4-PeCDF and PCB-126. To obtain a measure of sustained AHR activation, the fractional ethoxyresorufin-O,O- deethylase response is multiplied by the number of weeks. Hence, a fractional response of 50% at 14 weeks would be a sustained AHR activation index of 7. The sustained AHR activation index is plotted versus the AUC of hepatic toxic equivalents (TEQ) for all three chemicals calculated using TEF values of 1.0, 0.3 and 0.1 for TCDD, 4-PeCDF and PCB-126 respectively (Van den Berg et al., 2006) (Fig. 2, right column). The sustained AHR activation index shows a strong relationship to the AUC of hepatic TEQ and thus the sustained AHR activation index reflects the dose, potency and duration of DLCs in the liver.

Dose-response modeling can be performed using the sustained AHR activation index as the dose term and the measures of the various KEs or biomarkers as the response. Fig. 4 shows an example in which the well-known Hill dose-response model was used. One of the model parameters is the ED50 or EC50 value e in other words, the effective dose or concentration sufficient to produce a 50% of the maximal response. This parameter is also called the half- maximal dose. When this measure of sustained AHR activation is used, the ESA50 denotes the level of sustained AHR activation required for a half-maximal response.

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/167","Activation, LXR","KE 167","The LXR receptor

Liver X receptors (LXR) are ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily first identified in 1994 in rat liver (Apfel et al. 1994, Song 1994). There are two LXR isoforms termed a and &szlig; (NR1H3 and NR1H2) which upon activation form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to the LXR response element found in the promoter region of the target genes (Baranowski 2008). LXRs were shown to function as sterol sensors protecting the cells from cholesterol overload by stimulating reverse cholesterol transport and activating its conversion to bile acids in the liver (Baranowski 2008).

LXRa expression is restricted to liver, kidney, intestine, fat tissue, macrophages, lung, and spleen and is highest in liver, hence the name liver X receptor a (LXRa). LXR&beta; is expressed in almost all tissues and organs, hence the early name UR (ubiquitous receptor) (Ory 2004). The different pattern of expression suggests that LXRa and LXR&beta; have different roles in regulating physiological function. This is also supported from the observation that LXRa deficient mice do not develop hepatic steatosis when treated with LXR agonist that activates both types (Lund et al. 2006) and consequently the role of the two isoforms in relation to adverse effects could be different.

 

The molecular initiating event

Generally speaking chemicals that are able to act through NRs are usually specific ligands. These chemicals are mainly lipophilic and they mimic the action of natural hormones. However, in some cases hydrophilic chemicals (like phthalates) are also capable to act as ligands in NRs due to the molecular structure of the proteins and the pocket sites of the receptors.

The molecular initiating event in the presented MoA is the binding to the LXR or the permissive RXR of the LXR-RXR dimer leading to activation. LXR activation can be achieved via a wide range of endogenous neutral and acidic ligands as shown by crystallographic analysis (Williams et al. 2003). There are known endogenous but also synthetic ligands that can act as agonists. Endogenous agonists for this receptor are the oxysterols (oxidized cholesterol derivatives like 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and cholestenoic acid) mainly with similar affinity for the two isoforms (Baranowski 2008). Oxysterols bind directly to the typical hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal domain (Williams et al. 2003). Other endogenous ligands are the D-glucose and D-Glucose-6-phosphate (Mitro 2007). However, the hydrophilic nature of glucose and its low affinity for LXR present a challenge to the central dogma about the nature of the NR-ligand interaction (Lazar &amp; Wilson 2007). Unsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to bind and regulate LXRa activity in cells. However, in contrast to the role of oxysterols, the biological relevance of this observation has not been established in vivo (Pawar et al. 2003). The function of LXRs is also modulated by many currently used drugs such as statins, fibrates, and thazolidinedione derivatives (Jamroz-Wiśniewska et al. 2007). Some synthetic LXR agonists have been developed like the non-steroidal agonists T0901317 and GW3965 (Schultz et al 2000, Collins et al. 2002). LXR forms a permissive dimer with the RXR which means that chemicals that can activate this receptor can trigger the same pathway as the LXR agonists. The endogenous RXR agonist is 9-cis-retinoic acid (Heyman et al. 1992) while synthetic agonists include LGD1069 and LG100268 (Boehm et al. 1994 and 1995).

In addition to the agonist binding in the LXR there are other mechanisms for its control. LXRa gene promoter contains also functional peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a and &gamma; agonists were shown to stimulate LXRa expression in human and rodent (Baranowski 2008). Control of the LXRa expression is also dependent on insulin and post-translationally by protein kinase A that phosphorylates receptor protein at two sites thereby impairing its dimerization and DNA-binding (Baranowski 2008).

 

Identification of the site of action

As already mentioned above LXR isoforms are expressed in various tissues but in relation to the presented MoA we refer to LXRs that are expressed in the hepatocytes.

Nuclear receptors may be classified into two broad classes according to their sub-cellular distribution in the absence of ligand. Type I NRs (like ER and AhR) are located in the cytosol (and they are translocated into the nucleus after ligand binding) while type II NRs like LXRs (but also PXR, PPARa and PPAR&gamma;) are located in the nucleus of the cell.

The specific site of binding and the affinity of a ligand for the LXRs depend on the structure of the ligand.

 

Binding in the LXREs and target genes transcription

Upon ligand-induced activation both isoforms form obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and regulate gene expression through binding to LXR response elements (LXREs) in the promoter regions of the target genes (Fig. 1). The LXRE consists of two idealized hexanucleotide sequences (AGGTCA) separated by four bases (DR-4 element).

The SHF promotes heart tube elongation at the venous and arterial poles and contributes to the sub pulmonary myocardium (el Robrini et al., 2016; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1686","Deposition of Energy","KE 1686","Deposition of energy refers to events where energetic subatomic particles, nuclei, or electromagnetic radiation deposit energy in the media through which they transverse. The energy may either be sufficient (e.g. ionizing radiation) or insufficient (e.g. non-ionizing radiation) to ionize atoms or molecules (Beir et al.,1999). 

Ionizing radiation can cause the ejection of electrons from atoms and molecules, thereby resulting in their ionization and the breakage of chemical bonds.  The excitation of molecules can also occur without ionization. These events are stochastic and unpredictable. The energy of these subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves ranges from 124 keV to 5.4 MeV and is dependent on the source and type of radiation (Zyla et al., 2020). Not all electromagnetic radiation is ionizing; as the incident radiation must have sufficient energy to free electrons from the electron orbitals of the atom or molecule. The energy deposited can induce direct and indirect ionization events and can result from internal (injections, inhalation, ingestion) or external exposure. 

Direct ionization is the principal path where charged particles interact with biological structures such as DNA, proteins or  membranes to cause biological damage. Photons, which are electromagnetic waves can also deposit energy to cause direct which themselves can indirectly damage critical targets such as DNA (Beir et al., 1999; Balagamwala et al., 2013) or alter cellular processes. Given the fundamental nature of energy deposition by radioactive/unstable nuclei, nucleons or elementary particles in material, this process is universal to all biological contexts. 

The spatial structure of ionizing energy deposition along the resulting particle track is represented as linear energy transfer (LET) (Hall and Giaccia, 2018 UNSCEAR, 2020). High LET refers to energy mostly above 10 keV &mu;m-1 which produces more complex, dense structural damage than low LET radiation (below 10 keV &mu;m-1). Low-LET particles produce sparse ionization events such as photons (X- and gamma rays), as well as high-energy protons. Low LET radiation travels farther into tissue but deposits smaller amounts of energy, whereas high LET radiation, which includes heavy ions, alpha particles and high-energy neutrons, does not travel as far but deposits larger amounts of energy into tissue at the same absorbed dose. The biological effect of the deposition of energy can be modulated by varying dose and dose rate of exposure, such as acute, chronic, or fractionated exposures (Hall and Giaccia, 2018). 

Non-ionizing radiation is electromagnetic waves that does not have enough energy to break bonds and induce ion formation but it can cause molecules to excite and vibrate faster resulting in biological effects. Examples of non-ionizing radiation include radio waves (wavelength: 100 km-1m), microwaves (wavelength: 1m-1mm), infrared radiation (wavelength: 1mm- 1 um), visible light (wavelengths: 400-700 nm), and ultraviolet radiation of longer wavelengths such as UVB (wavelengths: 315-400nm) and UVA (wavelengths: 280-315 nm)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1690","Decrease, testosterone levels","KE 1690","Testosterone is an endogenous steroid hormone and a potent androgen. Androgens act by binding androgen receptors in androgen-responsive tissues (Murashima et al., 2015). Testosterone and other androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are important for reproductive development and masculinization of the fetus. Androgens are also important for bone, brain, muscle and skin health (Alemany, 2022). Just like other steroid hormones, testosterone is produced through a process known as steroidogenesis which is controlled by enzymes converting cholesterol into all of the downstream steroid hormones. In steroidogenesis, androstenedione or androstenediol is converted to testosterone by the enzymes 17&beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) or 3&beta;-HSD, respectively. Testosterone can then be converted to the more potent androgen, DHT, by 5&alpha;-reductase, or aromatized by aromatase (CYP19A1) into estrogens. Testosterone secreted in blood circulation can be found free but more frequently is found bound to SHBG or albumin (Trost &amp; Mulhall, 2016). 

Testosterone is produced mainly by the ovaries (in females ), testes (in males), and to  a lesser degree in the adrenal glands. During fetal development testosterone plays a crucial role in the differentiation of male reproductive tissues and the overall male phenotype. In adulthood, testosterone synthesis is controlled by the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis. GnRH is released from the hypothalamus inducing LH pulses secreted by the anterior pituitary. This LH surge leads to increased testosterone production. If testosterone reaches low levels, this axis is once again stimulated to provoke more testosterone synthesis. This feedback loop is essential for maintenance of appropriate testosterone levels (Chandrashekar &amp; Bartke, 1998; Ellis et al., 1983; Rey, 2021).

Disruption of any of the aforementioned processes may result in reduced testosterone levels, such as inhibition of steroidogenic enzyme activity thereby inhibiting production of testosterone. 

General role in biology

Androgens, the main male sex steroids, are the critical factors responsible for the development of the male phenotype during embryogenesis and for the achievement of sexual maturation at puberty. In adulthood, androgens remain essential for the maintenance of male reproductive function and behaviour. Apart from their effects on reproduction, androgens affect a wide variety of non-reproductive tissues such as skin, bone, muscle, and brain (Heemers, Verhoeven, &amp; Swinnen, 2006). Androgens, principally T and 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), exert most of their effects by interacting with a specific receptor, the androgen receptor (AR), for review see (Murashima, Kishigami, Thomson, &amp; Yamada, 2015). On the one hand, testosterone can be reduced by 5&alpha;-reductase to produce 5&alpha; dihydrotestosterone (DHT). On the other hand, testosterone can be aromatized to generate estrogens. Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence, postnatal effects in both males and females are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1700","Impaired IL-1R1 signaling in T cell","KE 1700","Decreased IL-1 production 


Decreased IL-1 production by macrophages or dendritic cells can be induced by suppressed IL-1&beta; mRNA induction or suppressed maturation of pro-IL-1&beta;. Dexamethasone is one of the representative drugs that significantly suppress IL-1&beta; production from monocytes (Finch-Arietta and Cochran, 1991). Other than dexamethasone, the inhibition of various targets in different layers from the stimulation of PRRs or the receptors of proinflammatory cytokines lto the activation of NF-&kappa;B or the inhibition of posttranscriptional regulation of pro-IL-1&beta; cause impaired IL-1R1 signaling. Among various PRRs, the signaling through TLR4 is best characterized. In addition, it is beyond the scope of this AOP to cover all signaling through each PRR. So, this AOP focuses on TLR4 signaling. 

 

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bacteria binds to TLR4 in complex with myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD2), and this complex initiates signalling by recruiting the adaptor proteins MyD88, TIR domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-&beta; (TRIF) and TIR-domain containing adaptor (TRAM). MYD88 associates with IL‑1R‑associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4 and recruits TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). This complex recruits TGF-&beta;-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), leading to phosphorylation of NF-&kappa;B inhibitor (I&kappa;B), activation of nuclear factor-&kappa;B (NF-&kappa;B) and consequent transcription of a range of genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, pto-IL-1b, and pro-IL-18 (Mills, 2011).

Therefore, chemicals that affect the signaling pathway leading to the activation of these transcription factors are supposed to suppress IL-1&beta; production. Among them, the chemical substances that affect NF-&kappa;B signaling have been investigated most thoroughly. Quite a few compounds have been reported to inhibit NF-&kappa;B signaling by several different mechanisms reviewed by Fuchs (Fuchs, 2010).  In fact, dimethyl fumarate inhibits the activation of NF‐&kappa;B, resulting in a loss of proinflammatory cytokine production, distorted maturation and function of antigen‐presenting cells, and immune deviation of T helper cells (Th) from the type 1 (Th1) and type 17 (Th17) profiles to a type 2 (Th2) phenotype (McGuire et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2012). Several studies have shown intriguing pharmacologic effects associated with curcumin, which inhibits NF-&kappa;B expression by regulating NF-&kappa;B/I&kappa;B pathway and down-regulates expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF&alpha; (Wang et al., 2018). Iguratimod, a methanesulfonanilide, that is a novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, inhibits NF-&kappa;B but not its inhibitor, I&kappa;B&alpha;, and inhibits the production of IL-1&beta; (Mucke, 2012). Epigalocathechin gallate (EGCG) has been reported to inhibit NF-&kappa;B activation through inhibition of p65 phosphorylation (Wheeler et al., 2004) and suppress the production of LPS-stimulated IL-1&beta; (Wang et al., 2020). DHMEQ inhibits lLPS-induced NF-&kappa;B activation by inhibiting its nuclear translocation from the cytoplasm. It also inhibits LPS-induced secretion of IL-1&beta; (Suzuki and Umezawa, 2006).

 

Other than the inhibitors for NF-&kappa;B signaling, which can be stimulated by various stimulations other than TLR4 stimulation, there are signaling molecules that are specific to TLR4 signaling, such as TLR4, Mal, TRAM, Myd88, IRAK4, and IRAK1/2 (Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009). There are several chemicals that targe some of these molecules, an inhibitors of TLR4 such as TAK-242 (Matsunaga et al., 2011) and various IRAK4 inhibitors (Lee et al., 2017). IRAK4 has recently attracted attention as a therapeutic target for inflammation and tumor diseases.

Beside transcriptional regulation of IL-1&beta; production, minocycline, and two prodrugs, pralnacasan (VX-740) and belnacasan (VX-765) that are orally absorbed and converted into the active principle, VRT-018858 and VRT-043198, respectively (Fenini et al., 2017) suppress IL-1 signaling by the inhibition of caspase-1 activation. Caspase-1 is an essential enzyme for maturation of pro- IL-1&beta; and the secretion of mature IL-1&beta; (Vincent and Mohr, 2007). Recently, it has been reported that cinnamicaldehyde suppresses serum IL-1&beta; level in endotoxin poisoning mice (Xu et al., 2017). 


	Blocking of binding of IL-1 to IL-1R1


IL-1&alpha; and IL-1&beta; independently bind the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), which is ubiquitously expressed. IL-1Ra binds IL-1R but does not initiate IL-1 signal transduction (Dripps et al., 1991). Recombinant IL-1Ra (anakinra) is fully active in blocking the IL-1R1, and therefore, the biological activities of IL-1&alpha; and IL-1&beta;. The binding of IL-1&alpha; and IL-1&beta; to IL-1R1 can be suppressed by soluble IL-1R like rilonacept (Kapur and Bonk, 2009). The binding of IL-1&beta; to IL-1R1 can be inhibited by anti-IL-1&beta; antibody (canakinumab and gevokizumab) (Church and McDermott, 2009) (Roell et al., 2010).

This AOP focus on the blocking of binding of IL-1 to IL-1R1, and an inhibition or suppression of IL-1 signaling is out of scope, because the molecular initiating event of IL-1 blocking is simple and appropriate for developing AOP. This AOP is expected to be applicable to any chemicals which bind to IL-1R, although such stressor has not been reported."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1702","Suppression of  T cell activation","KE 1702","T cells are key orchestrators of the response against pathogens and are also fundamental in maintaining self-tolerance. A number of clinically important conditions have been described in which T-cell functions are altered, as in AIDS or upon immunosuppression after application of various immunosuppressive drugs to treat autoimmune disorders or allogeneic graft rejection. T-cell progenitors differentiate in the thymus into immature T cells that acquire the expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR), which recognizes antigen peptides from pathogens presented along with major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In addition to the TCR, T cells are characterized by expression of the co-receptor molecules CD4 and CD8 on their cell surface. CD4+ T cells, also called T helper (Th) cells, recognize antigen/MHC-II complexes on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and coordinate the activation of other immune cells including B cells, macrophages, etc.

Therefore, CD4+ T cells are crucial for coordination of the immune response and for the elimination of invading pathogens. On the other hand, CD8+ T cells, referred to as T cytotoxic cells, recognize antigen/MHC-I complexes and are responsible for the killing of pathogen-infected cells.

T-cell activation and differentiation depends on antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and B cells. Depending on the insult affecting a given tissue, . Different subsets of DCs can be generated that in turn are able to coordinate the differentiation of a particular Th subset. To date, the following Th subsets have been described: Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, Tfh (follicular helper T cells), Tr1 (type 1regulatory T cells) and Treg (regulatory T cells), each possessing a specific function in the elimination of pathogens. (reviewed by Simeoni et al. (Simeoni et al., 2016))

Although CD4 T cells are able to commit to Th1, Th2 and Th17 lineages in the absence of IL-1R signaling at steady state, these committed CD4 T cells are unable to effectively secrete their cytokines upon TCR ligation. Namely, IL-1 is indispensable for CD4 T cell effector function. (Lin et al, 2015)

Moreover, since full activation of B cells and antibody production and class switch depends on T cell help. The impaired activation of T cells leads to impaired B cell activation and antibody production (reviewed by Mok (Mok, 2010))."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1706","Stimulation, TLR7/8","KE 1706","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are members of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor/TLR superfamily, as they share the intracellularToll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain with the IL-1 receptor.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8 is known to mediate the recognition of guanosine- and uridine-rich single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) derived from ssRNA viruses and synthetic antiviral imidazoquinoline components specifically that lead to activation of sequential signalling pathway (Akira et al. 2006, Blasius and Beutler. 2010). They also mediate the recognition of self RNA that is released from dead or dying cellsand activation of Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent signals can occur that leads to inflammation process as well as ssRNA derived from viruses.

TLR7 are exclusively expressed in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which have the capacity to secrete vast amounts of type I interferon (IFN) in rapid response to viral infection (Gilliet et al. 2008, Reizis et al. 2011). TLR8 is express in various tissues, with its highest expression in monocytes. Myeloid DCs (mDCs) also express TLR8 in human (Iwasaki and Medzhitov. 2004). Thus, TLR8 ligands can directly activate mDCs via TLR8. TLR8 signalling activates mDCs to secrete TNF-&alpha; and IL-6 (Ganguly et al. 2009). TLR7 and TLR8 are localize in the endoplasmic reticulum of expressing cells (Lai et al. 2017).

Human TLR7 (hTLR7) and human TLR8 (hTLR8) contain 1049 and 1041 amino acid residues, respectively with molecular weight of 120.9 kDa and 119.8 kDa, respectively (Chuang and Ulvitch. 2000). The full-length hTLR7 protein includes a signal peptide of 26 amino acids (1&ndash;26 aa). The mature hTLR7 protein ectodomain, trans-membrane, and TIR domain are composite structure of 27&ndash;839, 840&ndash;860, and 889&ndash;1,036 amino acids, respectively (Gupta et al. 2016).

hTLR7 and hTLR8 form a subfamily of proteins that each contain an extracellular domain of &gt;800 residues and share functional and structural features.  hTLR7 and hTLR8 contains 27 and 26 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which is the largest number of LRRs among TLRs whose structures have been reported (Tanji et al. 2013).

As mentioned above, TLR7 and TLR8 are localize in the endoplasmic reticulum of expressing cells. They are deliver to the endosomes by interacting UNC93B1, which is a 12 membrane-spanning protein (Kawai and Akira. 2011, Itoh et al. 2011). After the trafficking, they initiate cellular responses upon their activation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Lai et al. 2017).

Structural characterization was conducte with recombinant TLR7 from monkey (Macaca mulatta; 96.8% sequence identity with human TLR7) expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (Zhang et al. 2016). Rhesus TLR7 exists as a monomer in the absence of ligands. This TLR7 is activate by dimerization triggered by guanosine and uridine-containing ssRNA, which are degradation products of ssRNA, synergistically. Specifically, this TLR7 molecule has two ligand-binding sites. The first site conserved in TLR7 and TLR8 is use for small ligand-binding essential for its activation. The second site spatially distinct from that of TLR8 is use for ssRNA-binding that enhances the affinity of the first-site ligands. The first site preferentially recognize guanosine and the second site specifically bound to non-terminal uridine in ssRNA which have more than 3 bases. Rhesus TLR7 is also activate by dimerization induced by resiquimod alone, which is bound to only the first site (Zhang et al. 2016).

In contrast, hTLR8 exists as preformed dimer before ligand recognition. hTLR8 molecule has two ligand-binding sites as well as TLR7. The first site preferentially recognize uridine and second site recognize short-oligonucleotide. hTLR8 transforms into activated form upon binding of these two degradation products of ssRNA. hTLR8 is also activated by transformation induced by resiquimod alone, which is bound to only the first site (Tanji et al. 2015).

The key residues involved in TLR7 dimerization are LYS410, ASN503, SER504, GLY526, ASN527, SER530, THR532, ARG553, and TYR579 (Gupta et al. 2016).

Cellular signalling initiated by TLR7 activation with ssRNA in pDC is mediated in a Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent fashion, and activates NF-&kappa;B and IRF7, which results in induction of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon, respectively (Kawai and Akira. 2011).

MyD88-dependent IRF7 activation in pDCs is mediate by activation of IRAK1, TRAF6, TRAF3, and IKK&alpha; and is facilitate by IFN-inducible Viperin expressed in the lipid body (Kawai and Akira. 2011).

IRF7, which is constitutively expresse by pDCs, binds MyD88 and forms a multiprotein signalling complex with IRAK4, TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1 and IKK&alpha; (Kawai and Akira. 2008). In this complex, IRF7 becomes phosphorylate by IRAK1 and/or IKK&alpha;, dissociates from the complex and translocates into the nucleus to induce transcription of type I IFN by binding to its promoter proximal region (Kawai and Akira. 2008, G&eacute;nin et al. 2009).

Signalling initiated by TLR8 engagement with ssRNAs in endosomes is also mediated the MyD88-dependent pathway culminating in synthesis and release of proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF-&alpha; via NF-&kappa;B activation (Tanji et al. 2015)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1707","Increase, IL-23 from matured dendritic cells","KE 1707","Increased IL-23 synthesis from TNF-&alpha; and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-producing DCs (Tip-DCs) is a result of maturation from monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DC) to Tip-DC which is HLA-DR+CD40+CD86+DC-Lamp+ and CD83+ (Farkas and Kem&eacute;ny. 2011, Wilsmann-Theis et al. 2013).

Tip-DCs are abundant in inflamed tissue such as skin in patients of chronic inflammatory skin disease, and not present in the steady-state or normal skin tissue. These cells are derived from monocyte infiltrated during inflammation and contribute to innate immune response to pathogens including bacteria and parasites (Guilliams et al. 2014).

Increased production of cytokines including IL-12/IL-23p40 in Tip-DC stimulated with R848, an agonist of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 was reported (H&auml;nsel et al. 2011). In addition, maturation-dependent cytokine production including IL-23 from 6 hours in-vitro matured Tip-DC were observed when stimulated with CD40L and TLR ligands, such as LPS, PGN, Pam3Cys and R848 (H&auml;nsel et al. 2011).

IL-23 is a heterodimer, sharing a p40 subunit with IL-12 but having a distinct p19 subunit. IL-23 binds to IL-12R&beta;1 but not IL-12R&beta;2. The receptor for this cytokine is heterodimeric and uses a novel second subunit, IL-23R, which is a member of the hematopoietin receptor family (Lee et al. 2004)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1708","Th17 cell migration and inflammation induction","KE 1708","Psoriasis is known to play a major role in the etiology of T cell dysfunction, especially in over activation of the Th17 pathway, which Th17 cells were associated with Th1 and Th2 (Lisa C. et al. 2007) Th17 cell was identified as a cell population that produces different IL17. Abnormal activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR7, 8 and 9) is also involved in the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis. IMO-3100 (an antagonist of TLR7 and 9) and IMO-8400 (an antagonist of TLR7, 8 and 9) has been shown to reduce psoriasis-like skin lesions induced by intradermal administration of IL-23 on the back of mice (Mayte S-F et al. 2013). Immune cell infiltration in psoriasis lesions is composed of CD3 + Th1cell, Th17 cells and CD11c + dendritic cells (DC) (Chamian F et al 2005).

Cytokines such as TNF-&alpha;, IFN-&gamma;, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23, IL-12, and IL-1&beta; produced from these cells cause an inflammatory cascade. In particular, the IL-23 / Th17 axis plays an important role, and IL-23h is produce in DC, promotes the differentiation of naive CD4 + T cell progenitor cells into the Th17 phenotype, and stimulates the survival and expansion of the Th17 population  (Harrington LE et al. 2005) (Veldhoen M et al. 2006). IL-17 produced from Th17 cells regulates the expression of defensin, S100 family protein and LL-37. These are innate immune responses in the skin and show higher expression of IL-23 in keratinocytes and dermal tissues of psoriatic lesions than in non-lesions (Liang SC et al. 2006).

Overproduction of Th1 and TH17 cytokines is a major cause of psoriasis, and glucocorticoid (GC) regulates epidermal differentiation and acts as a potent anti-inflammatory compound to suppress the pathology of psoriasis. Synthetic glucocorticoids are uses to suppress inflammatory disease  including psoriasis, and induce the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a protein that inhibits major immune cell signaling pathways. CILZ is deficient in lesioned skin of psoriasis patients and shows a negative correlation with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-23, IL-22, and STAT3. Lisa et al. was identified a T cell-specific role of CILZ that limits Th17 cell formation in vitro in response to the Th17-promoting cytokines IL-1&beta; and IL-23 (Lisa M et al.2019). CILZ has the clinical significance of psoriasis as well as the non-redundant function of controlling pathogenic Th17 responses (Lisa M et al.2019).

One of the causes of psoriasis is an increase in pathogenic Th17 cells in people with a genetic predisposition stimulated by the production of Th17 polarized cytokines by bone marrow cells. The antibacterial peptide LL37, which forms a complex with nucleic acids released from cells, is an autoantigen that promotes the activation of cutaneous plasmacytoid dendritic cells and myeloid DCs, and Th17 cells are effector cytokines such as IL-17A. It activates keratinocytes directly through release. Activated keratinocytes proliferate abnormally and release inflammatory mediators and chemokines to amplify the inflammatory response (Boehncke WH et al.2015)."

The epidermis is composed of keratinocytes that differentiate to form a permeable barrier. Abnormal balance between proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes affects barrier function and causes inflammatory skin lesions. Psoriasis is a complex combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, and dysregulation of Th1 and Th17 lines is due to overproduction of cytokines including IFN-&alpha;, TNF-&alpha;, IL-23, IL-17, and IL-22. Causes overgrowth and skin immunity. (Harrington LE et al. 2005)

Psoriasis vulgaris shows overexpression of the S100 protein family soriacin (sorazine), cobunericin (kebuneridine), and epidermal antibacterial peptide (AMP). AMP is induced by IL-17 and itself functions as a chemotactic factor and cytokine. Mobilize CD4 + T cells and neutrophils that exacerbate inflammation. (Kanagawa Psoriasis Treatment Study Group)

Serum IL-17 levels in psoriasis patients are significantly higher than in healthy individuals, and brodalumab, a neutralizing antibody against the IL-17A receptor, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis (Gilliet et al. 2004). In addition, antibody preparations against IL-17 ixekizumab (John K. et al. 2002) and Szeimies et al. 2004 were used to treat psoriasis, and with positive results, Th17-mediated pathways are important for the etiology of psoriasis. It is believed to play a role. Immunohistological examination of biopsies of skin areas with psoriatic plaques, including surrounding normal skin, shows an increase in the number of activated dendritic cells, especially CD1a-positive Langerhans cells in the epidermis of psoriatic lesions. In CD83-positive CD1a-negative Langerhans, -negative CD11c-positive dermal dendritic cells increased in the epidermis at the border of psoriatic plaques. In normal skin, there were significantly fewer CD3-positive T lymphocytes than lesions.

CD4 and CD8 T cells infiltrate both the epidermis and dermis and show increased expression of IL17A, IL22, and IFNG in epidermal CD4 and CD8 T cells near keratinocytes, but with lower dermal T cell upregulation. IL-22, produced primarily by lesion epidermal CD4 T cells, is associated with keratinocyte activation and the formation of epidermal thickening, a prominent morphological feature of psoriasis. Lesion epithelial CD8 T cells mainly produce IL-17A and promote the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by keratinocytes. IL-17A is an important mediator of psoriatic inflammation through skin recruitment and activation of leukocytes. (Cheuk et al. 2014)

In patients with psoriasis, inflammatory keratin K6 and K16-positive keratinocytes were found, even in areas of normal-appearing skin that were not affected by psoriasis lesions. In addition, the transcription factor C / EBP&beta;, which is normally expressed only in the stratum granulosum of the healthy epidermis, was expressed throughout the epidermis, including the epidermis of the lesion. This suggests that early inflammatory changes have already occurred in areas that have not yet shown obvious skin lesions, and that these changes are caused by dendritic cells rather than lymphocytes.

It was reported that GATA-3 promotes Th2 responses through three different mechanisms (Zhu J. 2006).  Cell fate determination in each lineage requires at least two types of transcription factors: the master regulators (GATA3) as well as the signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins (Zhu J. 2010).  A direct role in bridging distant regulatory elements has been demonstrated for GATA3 at Th2 cytokine loci (Spilianakis and Flavell, 2004).  GATA3 is the Th2 master regulator (Zhu J．2010, Sung-Yun. 2004, Zhu J. 2004, Zheng W. 1997, Zhang DH. 1997), but it also plays important roles in multiple steps of CD4 T cell development (Ho IC. 2009).  GATA3 can act as pioneer factors by initiating local chromatin opening and allowing the recruitment of other transcription factors to regulatory elements (Spilianakis and Flavell, 2004).  Th2 differentiation is completely abolished both in vitro and in vivo when GATA3 is conditionally deleted in peripheral CD4 T cells (Zhu J. 2004, Pai SY. 2004).

STAT5 was originally purified and cloned from mammary epithelial cells in sheep and identified as a signal transducer that confers the specific biological responses of prolactin (Wakao, et al. 1992, Xu, et al. 1996).Thus, STAT5 proteins function as signal transduction molecules in the cytoplasm and as transcription factors upon translocation to the nucleus."

The activation of JAK kinases and STAT proteins by IL-2 and IFN-&alpha; does not include the T cell antigen receptor in human T lymphocytes (Beadling, et al. 1994). After activation of JAKs, latent STAT transcription factors induce dimeric STAT proteins (Gaffen, et al. 1995). These proteins then translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to and regulate the transcriptional activation of the promoters of target genes. Dimeric STAT proteins can bind to the palindromic gamma interferon-activated (GAS) sequence TTCNmGAA, where m is 3 for all the STATs, except STAT6. The latter can additionally bind to GAS motifs. The m for STAT6 denotes 4 (Darnell 1997, Decker, et al. 1997, Ihle 1996, Leonard and O&#39;Shea 1998)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1718","Suppression of IL-4 production","KE 1718","IL-4 is a mammalian protein found in Homo sapiens. IL-4 is pivotal in shaping the nature of immune responses. Upon activation, na&iuml;ve peripheral CD4+ T cells begin to synthesize and secrete cytokines. Type 2 helper cells (Th2 cells) produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13. IL-4 is a 15-kD polypeptide with pleiotropic effects on many cell types. In T cells, binding of IL-4 to its receptor induces proliferation and differentiation into Th2 cells. Th2 cells assist B cells in promoting class switching from IgM to IgG1 and IgE (Choi and Reiser 1998).

STAT5 phosphorylation facilitates the dimerization of STAT5, transport to the nucleus, and gene regulation (Levy and Darnell 2002). DNaseI hypersensitivity sites II (HSⅡ) and III (HSⅢ) in intron 2 have been identified in several regions of the Il4/Il13 locus. STAT5A binding to sites near HSⅡ and HSⅢ could provide a mechanism through which STAT5A mediates IL-4 gene accessibility and participates in the induction of IL-4 production (Zhu, et al. 2003). The CD3 antibody-induced phosphorylation of STAT5 can be downregulated by tofacitinib, suggesting that JAK3 inhibition by tofacitinib can downregulate STAT5-dependent cytokine signaling. Tofacitinib was shown to abrogate anti-CD3-induced STAT5 activation in CD4+ T cells and inhibit IL-4 production from CD4+ T cells (Migita, et al. 2011)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1719","Impairment of T-cell dependent antibody response","KE 1719","The production of antibodies to T cell-dependent antigens is a coordinated process involving B cells, antigen-presenting cells, and T cell derived cytokines. The B cells are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate. The TDAR might be altered if any of these cell populations are affected.

IL-2 and IL-4 are produced and secreted by helper T cells. Both are important in the development of TDAR. IL-4 affects maturation and class switching of B cells as well as proliferation. Both events induce and enhance TDAR. IL-2 promotes differentiation of B cells, which stimulates differentiation of activated T cells to Th2 cells. The suppressed production of IL-2 and IL-4 impairs TDAR (Justiz Vaillant and Qurie 2020).

A mutant form of human IL-4, in which the tyrosine residue at position 124 is replaced by aspartic acid (hIL-4Y124D), was reported to specifically block IL-4 and IL-13-induced proliferation of B cells. In addition, hIL-4Y124D also strongly inhibited both IL-4- or IL-13-induced IgG4 and IgE synthesis in cultures of PBMCs, or highly purified sIgD+ B cells cultured in the presence of anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies. IL-4 may be necessary to produce antibodies and to proliferate in B cells. The mutation of IL-4 may impair TDAR (Aversa, et al. 1993). 

IL-4 stimulates B cells to proliferate, switch immunoglobulin classes, and differentiate to plasma and memory cells. Suppressing the production of these B cell related cytokines appears to impair TDAR, as evident from the results of FK506 treatment (Heidt, et al. 2010).

STAT5 is able to inhibit peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-regulated gene transcription. Conversely, ligand-activated PPAR can inhibit STAT5-regulated transcription. As a peroxisome proliferator, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) induces PPARs. The suppression of TDAR has been observed with a no observable effect level (NOEL) of 1.88 mg/kg/d and lowest observed adverse effect level (LOEL) of 3.75 mg/kg/d for PFOA administered in drinking water over 15 days (Dewitt, et al. 2008). The increase in PPAR expression induced by PFOA may inhibit STAT5-regulated transcription, which is important for IL-4 production in TDAR."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1720","Trypsin inhibition","KE 1720","Trypsin is a digestive enzyme secreted by pancreatic acinar cells that cleaves peptide bonds at the carboxyl end of basic amino acids (lysine and arginine). Acinar cells secrete trypsinogen, the inactive form of trypsin, into the lumen of the duodenum; in turn, trypsinogen is auto-hydrolyzed by enterokinase into &beta;-trypsin, composed of an uncleaved single chain, and &alpha;-trypsin, composed of two cleaved chains bound by a disulfide bridge [Santos AMC et al, 2008]. Trypsin is required for the partial hydrolysis of chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin, and most pancreatic digestive enzyme precursors are activated by trypsin in the same manner as chymotrypsin in the intestinal lumen.

As part of the defense against trypsin-induced self injury in the pancreas, internal TIs such as the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1 or human pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) and bovine pancreatic TI in the pancreatic juice and &alpha;1-antitrypsin in the serum bind tightly to active trypsin [Voet D and Voet JG, 1995].

Secretion of pancreatic digestive enzymes including trypsin is regulated mainly by CCK released from enteroendocrine I cells in the duodenal mucosa of the small intestine [Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007], and CCK release is controlled by multiple mechanisms [Caron J et al, 2017]. One such mechanism is trypsin-mediated negative feedback regulation, in which increased trypsin secretion leads to decreased levels of trypsin-sensitive luminal CCK-releasing factors (LCRFs) in several mammalian species and MP in rodents [Liddle RA, 1995; Miyasaka K and Funakoshi A, 1998].

Therefore, ingestion of RSF containing trypsin inhibitory action or protease inhibitors such as camostat inhibits trypsin activity in the intestinal lumen, which leads to increased luminal levels of the abovementioned trypsin-sensitive peptides and thereby stimulation of CCK release [Green GM and Miyasaka K, 1983; Cuber JC et al, 1990; Miyasaka K et al, 1989; Cuber JC et al, 1990; Komarnytsky S et al, 2011]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1721","Increased intestinal monitor peptide level","KE 1721","Trypsin-mediated feedback regulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion is commonly found among vertebrate species.

In rats, trypsin-sensitive monitor peptide (MP), a pancreatic soluble trypsin inhibitor (TI) found in pancreatic juice that protects against trypsin-induced auto-injury [Iwai K et al, 1987; Iwai K et al, 1988; Tsuzuki S et al, 1991; Tsuzuki S et al, 1992], plays a major role in stimulating pancreatic exocrine secretion via cholecystokinin (CCK) release [Miyasaka K et al, 1989; Fushiki T et al, 1989; Miyasaka K and Funakoshi A, 1998].

MP is a peptide consisting of 61 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 6000 and is secreted from pancreatic acinar cells along with other pancreatic enzymes [Iwai K et al, 1987].MP is reported to have trypsin inhibitory activity [Lin YZ et al, 1990], and it forms complexes with trypsin in the empty intestine, similar to other pancreatic soluble TIs [Voet D and Voet JG, 1995], which keeps the intestinal level of free MP low. However, once the gastric contents are transported to the small intestine, secretion of the pancreatic proteases with MP are induced, where trypsin is used for protein hydrolysis, and the level of free MP is subsequently increased [Iwai K et al, 1988; Graf R, 2006]. The increased MP level stimulates CCK release from I cells lining the small intestinal mucosa via MP receptors [Liddle RA et al, 1992; Yamanishi R et al, 1993; Yamanishi R et al, 1993; Liddle RA et al, 1992], and the resulting increase in CCK stimulates exocrine secretion from the pancreas. MP secretion is simultaneously increased to stimulate CCK release further. Therefore, MP-mediated regulation of trypsin and related proteases appears to act via a positive feedback loop as long as duodenal contents remain to consume trypsin for proteolysis.

In accordance with the increased secretion of pancreatic enzymes, proteolysis of the intestinal contents lowers protein levels in the intestinal lumen, which once again lowers the intestinal level of free MP due to the excess of trypsin. CCK release is decreased in accordance with the decreased intestinal MP level, followed by a decrease in pancreatic exocrine secretion [Liddle RA, 1995; Miyasaka K and Funakoshi A, 1998].

After ingestion of raw soya flour, which contains trypsin inhibitory activity, or TIs such as camostat, TI&ndash;trypsin complexes are formed, and the intestinal level of free MP is increased to stimulate CCK release [Yamanishi R et al, 1993], increasing the blood CCK level. Increased CCK further stimulates MP as well as other pancreatic enzymes via positive feedback regulation [Liddle RA, 1995]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1722","Increased blood CCK level","KE 1722","Pancreatic exocrine secretion is controlled by multiple mechanisms [Caron J et al, 2017; Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007; Wang Y et al, 2011], many of which are mediated by CCK secreted by CCK-producing I cells lining the mucosa of the small intestine [Singer MV and Niebergall-Roth E, 2009; Rehfeld JF, 2017]. CCK is also synthesized in cerebral neurons and expressed in several endocrine and certain other cells, and they are involved in many functions other than pancreatic exocrine secretion, including gall bladder contraction, gut motility, and satiety [Rehfeld JF, 2017].

CCK is initially synthesized as a peptide prohormone comprising 150 amino acids, which is processed into active CCK by prohormone convertases specific to the cell type and species [Rehfeld JF et al, 2003; Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007]. CCKs exist as several isoforms that differ due to post-translational modifications, although the C-terminal amino acid sequences are conserved among these isoforms [Rehfeld JF et al, 2001; Rehfeld JF, 2017].

CCK release is stimulated mainly by gastric contents containing fatty acids and amino acids transported into the small intestine. The factors in gastric chyme that stimulate CCK release differ among species, with fats, fatty acids, proteins, and amino acids being the key players in humans, fatty acids and amino acids in canines, and digested/undigested proteins in rats [Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007; Caron J et al, 2017]. These factors stimulate intestinal mucosal I cells to release CCK into the blood either directly via specific receptors such as calcium-sensing receptors and the G protein-coupled receptor GPR93 or indirectly via luminal CCK-releasing factors (LCRFs) [Caron J et al, 2017]. LCRFs are released from intestinal mucosal cells in response to amino acids and fatty acids in humans [Liddle RA, 1997; Liddle RA, 2000] ; however, the peptides mediate negative feedback regulation of CCK release via CCK degradation by pancreatic proteases [Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007].

In addition to the negative feedback regulation of CCK release in rodents, CCK release is stimulated by monitor peptide (MP), a pancreatic soluble trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) secreted into the upper intestine from pancreatic acinar cells [Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007]. MP, which is trypsin-sensitive, stimulates intestinal I cells to release CCK via positive feedback regulation, in that the resulting increased CCK level stimulates the secretion of MP together with other pancreatic enzymes [Liddle RA, 1995; Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007; Miyasaka K and Funakoshi A, 1998]

When trypsin is inhibited in rodents, trypsin-sensitive MP-induced CCK release is overstimulated due to positive feedback regulation of CCK release by trypsin."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1723","Increased exocrine secretion from pancreatic acinar cells","KE 1723","The major function of pancreatic exocrine secretion is secretion of digestive enzymes, fluid, and bicarbonate in response to food intake. Zymogen granules located at the apical site of pancreatic acinar cells contain the precursors of multiple digestive enzymes, such as trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proesterase, procarboxypeptidase A and B, as well as pancreatic lipase and amylase &alpha;. These precursors are secreted into the small intestine, where trypsinogen is converted to trypsin by enteropeptidase, and the newly generated trypsin activates more trypsinogen molecules and other proenzymes [Berg JM et al, 2002].

Pancreatic exocrine secretion is regulated mainly by CCK released from CCK-producing I cells located within the mucosa of the small intestine. CCK stimulates exocrine secretion either directly via CCK receptors expressed on acinar cells or indirectly by the vagovagal reflex via CCK receptors. There are species differences in these CCK regulatory mechanisms [Singer MV and Niebergall-Roth E, 2009; Chandra R and Liddle RA, 2009].

There are two types of CCK receptors: CCK1 (CCK-A) and CCK2 (CCK-B or gastrin) receptors. The CCK1 receptor exhibits high affinity to all CCK isoforms, whereas the CCK2 receptor exhibits affinity to both CCK and gastrin, in which the last five amino acid sequences at the C-terminus end are identical [Dufresne M et al, 2006; Rehfeld JF, 2017].

In rats, pancreatic acinar cells express mainly CCK1 receptors, and blood CCK directly stimulates exocrine secretion and acinar cell proliferation [Dufresne M et al, 2006]. Moreover, the vagal afferent nerves also stimulate pancreatic exocrine secretion; CCK stimulates CCK1 receptors expressed on the vagal afferent nerve fibers of the vago&ndash;vagal reflex loop, and the acetylcholine generated acts on M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors to promote pancreatic exocrine secretion [Bourassa J et al, 1999; Adler G, 1997; Ji B et al, 2001; Li Y et al, 1997; Owyang C, 1996]. Moreover, when the gastric wall is distended with ingested food, the vagus nerve is stimulated to promote pancreatic exocrine secretion [Dufresne M et al, 2006].

In humans, the density of CCK receptors expressed on acinar cells is lower than that in rodents, whereas CCK2 receptors are dominantly expressed. Therefore, the responses of acinar cells to CCK seem to be weaker compared with rodents, and pancreatic exocrine secretion in humans is regulated mainly by vagal afferent nerves expressing CCK1 receptors [Wang BJ and Cui ZJ, 2007; Owyang C, 1996; Pandiri AR, 2014]."

In rats with a sustained increase in the CCK level due to treatment with a CCK1 receptor agonist (CCK-8), acinar cell proliferation and pancreatic hypertrophy were induced [Folsch UR et al, 1978; Povoski SP et al, 1994]. Endogenous and exogenous increases in blood CCK levels induced pancreatic hypertrophy due to the direct action of CCK on acinar cells [Yamamoto M et al, 2003]. Repeated administration of the CCK1 receptor agonist GI181771X to rats and mice resulted in pancreatic injury, hypertrophy and diffuse/focal hyperplasia of acinar cells, and zymogen degranulation depending on the dose and dosing period [Myer JR et al, 2014].

Administration of the trypsin inhibitor A8947 to rats increased pancreatic weight; however, infusion of the selective CCK1 receptor antagonist MK-329 using an osmotic minipump completely diminished this effect of A8947 on pancreatic weight [Obourn JD et al, 1997].

These results indicate that CCK directly stimulates pancreatic acinar cell proliferation via CCK1 receptors, and trypsin inhibition enhances acinar cell proliferation due to an increased plasma level of CCK."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1738","SARS-CoV-2 cell entry","KE 1738","Coronavirus is recognized by the binding of S protein on the viral surface and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cellular membrane, followed by viral entry via processing of S protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). ACE2 is expressed on epithelial cells of the lung and intestine, and also can be found in the heart, kidney, adipose, and male and female reproductive tissues (Lukassen et al., 2020, Lamers et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020, Jing et al., 2020, Subramanian et al., 2020). 

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus characterized by displaying spike proteins at the viral surface (Juraszek et al., 2021). Spike is critical for viral entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020b) and is the primary target of vaccines and therapeutic strategies, as this protein is the immunodominant target for antibodies (Yuan et al., 2020, Ju et al., 2020, Robbiani et al., 2020, Premkumar et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020). Spike is composed of S1 and S2 subdomains. S1 contains the N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding (RBD) domains, and the S2 contains the fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2, the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains (CD) (Lan et al., 2020). S1 leads to the recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and S2 is involved in membrane fusion (Hoffmann et al., 2020b, Letko et al., 2020, Shang et al., 2020).

Upon binding to ACE2, the spike protein needs to be activated (or primed) through proteolytic cleavage (by a host protease) to allow membrane fusion. Fusion is a key step in viral entry as it is the way to release SARS-CoV-2 genetic material inside the cell. Cleavage happens between its spike&rsquo;s S1 and S2 domains, liberating S2 that inserts its N-terminal domain into a host cell membrane and mediates membrane fusion (Millet and Whittaker, 2018). Many proteases were identified to activate coronaviruses including furin, cathepsin L, trypsin-like serine proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11, and human airway trypsin-like protease (HATs). These may operate at four different stages of the virus infection cycle: (a) pro-protein convertases (e.g., furin) during virus packaging in virus-producing cells, (b) extracellular proteases (e.g., elastase) after virus release into extracellular space, (c) cell surface proteases [e.g., type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2)] after virus attachment to virus-targeting cells, and (d ) lysosomal proteases (e.g., cathepsin L) after virus endocytosis in virus-targeting cells (Li, 2016). SARS-CoV-2 lipidic envelope may fuse with two distinct membrane types, depending on the host protease(s) responsible for cleaving the spike protein: (i) cell surface following activation by serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 and furin (Hoffmann et al., 2020b); or (ii) endocytic pathway within the endosomal&ndash;lysosomal compartments including processing by lysosomal cathepsin L (Yang and Shen, 2020). These flexibility for host cell factors mediating viral entry, highlights that the availability of factors existing in a cell type dictates the mechanism of viral entry (Kawase et al., 2012). When TMPRSS2 (or other serine proteases such as TMPRSS4 (Zang et al., 2020) or human airway trypsin-like protease [HAT] (Bestle et al., 2020a)) is expressed, fusion of the virus with the cell surface membrane is preferred (Shirato et al., 2018), while in their absence, the virus can penetrate the cell by endocytosis (Kawase et al., 2012). A third factor has also been shown to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry in cells that have ACE2 and even promote, although to very low levels, SARS-CoV-2 entry in cells that lack ACE2 and TMPRSS2 which is the neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020). This key event deals with SARS-CoV-2 entry in host cells and is divided in three categories: TMPRSS2, capthesin L and NRP-1.

TMPRSS2 Spike cleavage:

TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2, (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7113) is a cell-surface protease (Hartenian et al., 2020) that facilitates entry of viruses into host cells by proteolytically cleaving and activating viral envelope glycoproteins. Viruses found to use this protein for cell entry include Influenza virus and the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).

TMPRSS2 is a membrane bound serine protease also known as epitheliasin. TMPRSS2 belongs to the S1A class of serine proteases alongside proteins such as factor Xa and trypsin. Whilst there is evidence that TMPRSS2 autoclaves to generate a secreted protease, its physiological function has not been clearly identified. However, it is known to play a crucial role in facilitating entry of coronavirus particles into cells by cleaving the spike protein (Huggins, 2020).

After ACE2 receptor binding, SARS-CoV-2 S proteins can be subsequently cleaved and activated by host cell-surface protease at the S1/S2 and S2&rsquo; sites, generating the subunits S1 and S2 that remain non-covalently linked. Cleavage leads to activation of the S2 domain that drives fusion of the viral and host membranes (Hartenian et al., 2020, Walls et al., 2016). For other coronaviruses, processing of spike was proposed to be sequential with S1/S2 cleavage preceding that of S2. Cleavage at S1/S2 may be crucial for inducing conformational changes required for receptor binding or exposure of the S2 site to host proteases. 

The S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains an insertion of four amino acids providing a minimal furin cleavage site (RRAR685&darr;) (that is absent in SARS-CoV). Interestingly, the furin cleavage site has been implicated in increased viral pathogensis (Bestle et al., 2020b, Huggins, 2020). Processing of the spike protein by furin at the S1/S2 cleavage site is thought to occur following viral replication in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Hasan et al., 2020). The spike S2&rsquo; cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 possesses a paired dibasic motif with a single KR segment (KR815&darr;) (as SARS-CoV) that is recognized by trypsin-like serine proteases such as TMPRSS2. The current data support a model for SARS-CoV-2 entry in which furin-mediated cleavage at the S1/S2 site pre-primes spike during biogenesis, facilitating the activation for membrane fusion by a second cleavage event at S2&rsquo; by TMPRSS2 following ACE2 binding (Bestle et al., 2020b, Johnson et al., 2020).

Camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells like Calu-3 cells but not Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells. Cell entry was assessed using a viral isolate and viral pseudotypes (artificial viruses) expressing the COVID-19 spike (S) protein. The ability of the viral pseudotypes (expressing S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to enter human and animal cell lines was demonstrated, showing that SARS-CoV-2 can enter similar cell lines as SARS-CoV. Amino acid analysis and cell culture experiments showed that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and uses a cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming. Priming activates the spike protein to facilitate viral fusion and entry into cells. Cell culture experiments were performed using immortalized cell lines and primary human lung cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020b, Rahman et al., 2020).

 

Spike binding to neuropilin-1:

Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a cell surface receptor for semaphorins and various ligands involved in angiogenesis in vertebrates. NRP1 is expressed in neurons, blood vessels (endothelial cells), immune cells and many other cell types in the mammalian body (maternal fetal interface) and binds a range of structurally and functionally diverse extracellular ligands to modulate organ development and function (Raimondi et al., 2016).  NRP1 is well described as a co-receptor for members of the class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3) or vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) (Gelfand et al., 2014). Structurally, NRP1 comprises seven sub-domains, of which the first five are extracellular; two CUB domains (a1 and a2), two coagulation factor V/VIII domains (FV/VIII; b1 and b2) and a meprin, A5 &mu;-phosphatase domain (MAM; c). NRP1 contains only a short cytosolic tail with a PDZ-binding domain lacking internal signaling activity. The different ligand families bind to different sites of NRP1; SEMA3A binding requires the first three sub-domains of NRP1 (a1, a2, and b1), whereas binding of VEGF-A requires the b1 and b2 domains (Muhl et al., 2017). Additional studies conducted by means of in silico computational technology to identify and validate inhibitors of the interaction between NRP1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are reported in (Perez-Miller et al., 2020).  Represents a schematic picture of VEGF-A triggered phosphorylation of VEGF-R2. Screening of NRP-1/VEGF-A165 inhibitors by in-cell Western (Perez-Miller et al., 2020).v NRP1 acts as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. 

NRP1 is a receptor for furin-cleaved SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020, Daly et al., 2020, Johnson et al., 2020). Blockade of NRP1 reduces infectivity and entry, and alteration of the furin site leads to loss of NRP1 dependence, reduced replication in Calu3, augmented replication in Vero E6, and attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis disease model (Johnson et al., 2020). In fact, a small sequence of amino acids was found that appeared to mimic a protein sequence found in human proteins that interact with NRP1. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binding with NRP1 aids viral infection of human cells. This was confirmed by applying a range of structural and biochemical approaches to establish that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 does indeed bind to NRP1. The host protease furin cleaves the full-length precursor S glycoprotein into two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2. Cleavage of S generates a polybasic RRAR C-terminal sequence on S1, which conforms to a C-end rule (CendR) motif that binds to cell surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors. It was reported that the S1 CendR motif directly bound NRP1 by X-ray crystallography and biochemical approaches. Blocking this interaction using RNAi or selective inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infectivity in cell culture (Daly et al., 2020).

NRP1, known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, significantly potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, which was revealed by a monoclonal blocking antibody against NRP1. It was found that a SARS-CoV-2 mutant with an altered furin cleavage site did not depend on NRP1 for infectivity. Pathological analysis of olfactory epithelium obtained from human COVID-19 autopsies revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infected NRP1-positive cells faced the nasal cavity (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020). Furthermore, it has been found that NRP1 is a new potential SARS‑CoV‑2 infection mediator implicated in the neurologic features and central nervous system involvement of COVID‑19.  Preclinical studies have suggested that NRP1, a transmembrane receptor that lacks a cytosolic protein kinase domain and exhibits high expression in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, may also be implicated in COVID‑19 by enhancing the entry of SARS‑CoV‑2 into the brain through the olfactory epithelium. NRP1 is also expressed in the CNS, including olfactory‑related regions such as the olfactory tubercles and paraolfactory gyri. Supporting the potential role of NRP1 as an additional SARS‑CoV‑2 infection mediator implicated in the neurologic manifestations of COVID‑19. Accordingly, the neurotropism of SARS‑CoV‑2 via NRP1‑expressing cells in the CNS merits further investigation (Davies et al., 2020).

 

Up-regulation of NRP1 protein in diabetic kidney cells hints at its importance in a population at risk of severe COVID-19. Involvement of NRP-1 in immune function is compelling, given the role of an exaggerated immune response in disease severity and deaths due to COVID-19. NRP-1 has been suggested to be an immune checkpoint of T cell memory. It is unknown whether involvement and up-regulation of NRP-1 in COVID-19 may translate into disease outcome and long-term consequences, including possible immune dysfunction (Mayi et al., 2021).

The main feature of NRP1 co-receptor is to form complexes with multiple other receptors. Hence, there is a competition between receptors to complex with NRP-1, which may determine their abilities both quantitatively and qualitatively to transduce signals. It is tempting to hypothesize that the occupancy of NRP-1 with one receptor may thus decrease its availability for virus entry. Recent proteomics work has shown that NRP-1 can form a complex with the &alpha;7 nicotinic receptor in mice. Both receptors are expressed in the human nasal and pulmonary epithelium (Mayi et al., 2021).

NRP1, is highly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium; it is also expressed in the CNS, including olfactory related regions such as the olfactory tubercles and paraolfactory gyri (Davies et al., 2020).

Spike entry via lysosomal cathepsins and endocytosis:

Evidence shows the role of TMPRSS2 and other serine proteases in activating the coronavirus spike protein for plasma membrane fusion. However, studies using various cell culture systems showed that SARS-CoV2 could enter cells via an alternative endosomal&ndash;lysosomal pathway. Evidence came from studies demonstrating that lysosomotropic agents reduced SARS-CoV replication in cells lacking TMPRSS2 and other studies, using highly potent and specific small-molecule cathepsin inhibitors, to understand the role of cathepsins in processing and activating the spike for membrane fusion, mainly of cathepsin L (one of the 11 cathepsins) (Rossi et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2005). SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses can establish infection through endosomal entry in commonly used in vitro cell culture systems. Of relevance, inhibitors of the endosomal pathway, as the cathepsin inhibitor Z-FA-FMK and PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod, blocked viral entry in Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells but not Calu-3 cells.

Viral entry leads to delivery of virion proteins and translation of viral proteins immediately: 

Coronavirus is a class of viruses that have single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes in their envelopes [Kim D, et al., 2020]. The virus contains a 29.7 kB positive-sense RNA genome flanked by 5&#39; and 3&#39; untranslated regions of 265 and 342 nucleotides, respectively that contain cis-acting secondary RNA structures essential for RNA synthesis [Huston N. C. et al., 2021]. The genome just prior to the 5&prime; end contains the transcriptional regulatory sequence leader (TRS-L) [Budzilowicx C.J., et al., 1985]. The SARS-CoV genome is polycistronic and contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) that are expressed by poorly understood mechanisms [Snijder E. J., et al., 2003]. Preceding each ORF there are other TRSs called the body TRS (TRS B). The 5&prime; two-thirds of the genome contains two large, overlapping, nonstructural ORFs and the 3&prime; third contains the remainder ORFs [Di H., et al., 2018]. Genome expression starts with the translation of two large ORFs of the 5&rsquo; two-thirds: ORF1a of 4382 amino acids and ORF1ab of 7073 amino acid that occurs via a programmed (- 1) ribosomal frameshifting [Snijder E. J., et al., 2003], yielding pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins are cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases encoded by ORF1a, nsp3, and nsp5 that contain a papain-like protease domain and a 3C-like protease domain [Sacco M. D. et al., 2020]. The processing products are a group of replicative enzymes, named nsp1-nsp16, that assemble into a viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) associated with membranes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the help of various membrane-associated viral proteins [Klein S., et al., 2021, Snijder E. J., et al., 2020, V&#39;Kovski P. , et al., 2021]. This association leads to replication factories or organelles, that are originate new membranous structures that are observed by electron mciroscopy . They are a feature of all coronaviridae and the site of viral replication and transcription hidden from innate immune molecules."

ACE2 receptors in the brain (endothelial, neuronal and glial cells):

The highest ACE2 expression level in the brain was found in the pons and medulla oblongata in the human brainstem, containing the medullary respiratory centers (Lukiw et al., 2020). High ACE2 receptor expression was also found in the amygdala, cerebral cortex and in the regions involved in cardiovascular function and central regulation of blood pressure including the sub-fornical organ, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, paraventricular nucleus, and rostral ventrolateral medulla (Gowrisankar and Clark 2016; Xia and Lazartigues 2010). The neurons and glial cells, like astrocytes and microglia also express ACE-2. 

In the brain, ACE2 is expressed in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells (Hamming et al., 2004), as well as in neurons and glia (Gallagher et al., 2006; Matsushita et al., 2010; Gowrisankar and Clark, 2016; Xu et al., 2017; de Morais et al., 2018) (from Murta et al., 2020). Astrocytes are the main source of angiotensinogen and express ATR1 and MasR; neurons express ATR1, ACE2, and MasR, and microglia respond to ATR1 activation (Shi et al., 2014; de Morais et al., 2018). 

ACE2 receptors in the intestines

The highest levels of ACE2 are found at the luminal surface of the enterocytes, the differentiated epithelial cells in the small intestine, lower levels in the crypt cells and in the colon (Liang et al, 2020; Hashimoto et al., 2012, Fairweather et al. 2012; Kowalczuk et al. 2008)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1753","Chronic reactive oxygen species","KE 1753","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are radicals, ions, or molecules that have a single unpaired electron in their outermost shell of electrons, which can be categorized into two groups: free oxygen radicals and non-radical ROS [Liou et al., 2010]. Free oxygen radicals include superoxide (O2&middot;-), hydroxyl radical (&middot;OH), nitric oxide (NO&middot;), organic radicals (R&middot;), peroxyl radicals (ROO&middot;), alkoxyl radicals (RO&middot;), thiyl radicals (RS&middot;), sulfonyl radicals (ROS&middot;), thiyl peroxyl radicals (RSOO&middot;), and disulfides (RSSR). Non-radical ROS include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), singlet oxygen (1O2), ozone/trioxygen (O3), organic hydroperoxides (ROOH), hypochlorite (ClO-), peroxynitrite (ONOO-), nitrosoperoxycarbonate anion (O=NOOCO2-), nitrocarbonate anion (O2NOCO2-), dinitrogen dioxide (N2O2), nitronium (NO2+), and highly reactive lipid- or carbohydrate-derived carbonyl compounds [Liou et al., 2010].

ROS are generated through NADPH oxidases consists of p47phox and p67phox. Arsenic produces ROS [Zhang et al., 2011]. The primary site of action for this event is DNA or proteins etc.

ROS play an important role in tumorigenesis [Zhang et al., 2011].

Chronic low-level increased ROS can alter the tumor microenvironment and promote cancer stem cell renewal, leading to therapeutic resistance [Gu et al., 2018]. 

The reason why this chronic ROS KE has been created is because it is important to have chronic ROS, but not just instant increased ROS, since ROS have a double-edged effect."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1754","Porcupine-induced Wnt secretion and Wnt signaling activation","KE 1754","Porcupine, which is a trans-membrane endoplasmic reticulum O-acyl transferase, is important for the secretion of Wnt ligands(Saha et al., 2016a). WNTs are secreted proteins that contain 22-24 conserved cysteine residues (Foulquier et al., 2018). The WNT molecules consist of molecular families including WNT1, WNT2, WNT2B/WNT13, WNT3, WNT4, WNT5A, WNT5B, WNT6, WNT7A, WNT7B, WNT8A, WNT8B, WNT10B, WNT11, and WNT16. (Clevers &amp; Nusse, 2012; M. Katoh, 2001; Kusserow et al., 2005) 



Wnt proteins consist of 350-400 amino acids (Saito-Diaz et al., 2013).

WNT ligands are known to trigger at least three different downstream signaling cascades including canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway, non-canonical WNT/Ca2+ pathway, and planer cell polarity (PCP) pathway(De, 2011; Lai, Chien, &amp; Moon, 2009; Willert &amp; Nusse, 2012). WNTs bind to Frizzled proteins, which are seven-pass transmembrane receptors with an extracellular N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (Bhanot et al., 1996; Clevers, 2006). Wnt signaling begins with the binding of Wnt ligand towards the Frizzled receptors (Mohammed et al., 2016).

Dishevelled (DVL), a positive regulator of Wnt signaling, forms the complex with FZD and leads to trigger the Wnt signaling together with Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) (Clevers &amp; Nusse, 2012; Jiang, et al., 2015). DVL, however, has a controversial role to promote Wnt receptor degradation (Jiang et al., 2015). Meanwhile, DVL-dependent regulation of FZD level is involved in mTORC1 signaling suppression via Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (Zeng et al., 2018). The recruitment of Axin to the DVL-FZD complex induces the beta-catenin stabilization and activation. The stabilized beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, which forms the complex with TCF to induce the up-regulated expression of proliferation-related genes."

11-ketotestosterone is a dominant androgen in teleost fish (Borg 1994). It is synthesized from testosterone using the enzymes CYP11b1 and HSD11b (Yazawa et al., 2008; Swart et al., 2013).

Fin regeneration is a complex process involving coordinated cellular processes such as cellular signaling, differentiation, and migration (Wehner &amp; Weidinger, 2015). Commonly known signaling pathways such as activin signaling, notch signaling and wnt signaling all play a role in the process of fin regeneration (Wehner &amp; Weidinger, 2015).  Poss et al (2003) outline fin regeneration as follows:

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/177","Mitochondrial dysfunction","KE 177","Mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of inhibition of the respiratory chain leading to oxidative stress.

Mitochondria can be found in all cells and are considered the most important cellular consumers of oxygen. Furthermore, mitochondria possess numerous redox enzymes capable of transferring single electrons to oxygen, generating the superoxide (O2-). Some mitochondrial enzymes that are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation include the electron-transport chain (ETC) complexes I, II and III; pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). The transfer of electrons to oxygen, generating superoxide, happens mainly when these redox carriers are charged enough with electrons and the potential energy for transfer is elevated, like in the case of high mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, ROS generation is decreased if there are not enough electrons and the potential energy for the transfer is not sufficient (reviewed in Lin and Beal, 2006).

Cells are also able to detoxify the generated ROS due to an extensive antioxidant defence system that includes superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, catalase, thioredoxins, and peroxiredoxins in various cell organelles (reviewed in Lin and Beal, 2006). It is worth mentioning that, as in the case of ROS generation, antioxidant defences are also closely related to the redox and energetic status of mitochondria. If mitochondria are structurally and functionally healthy, an antioxidant defence mechanism balances ROS generation, and there is not much available ROS production. However, in case of mitochondrial damage, the antioxidant defence capacity drops and ROS generation takes over. Once this happens, a vicious cycle starts and ROS can further damage mitochondria, leading to more free-radical generation and further loss of antioxidant capacity. During mitochondrial dysfunction the availability of ATP also decreases, which is considered necessary for repair mechanisms after ROS generation.

A number of proteins bound to the mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum (ER), especially in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), are playing an important role of communicators between these two organelles (reviewed Mei et al., 2013). ER stress induces mitochondrial dysfunction through regulation of Ca2+ signaling and ROS production (reviewed Mei et al., 2013). Prolonged ER stress leads to release of Ca2+ at the MAM and increased Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix, which induces Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. At the same, ROS are produced by proteins in the ER oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1) family. ER stress activates ERO1 and leads to excessive production of ROS, which, in turn, inactivates SERCA and activates inositol-1,4,5- trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) via oxidation, resulting in elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+, increased mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+, and ultimately mitochondrial dysfunction. Just as ER stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction also induces ER Stress (reviewed Mei et al., 2013). For example, nitric oxide disrupts the mitochondrial respiratory chain and causes changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ flux which induce ER stress. Increased Ca2+ flux triggers loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), release of cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), decreasing ATP synthesis and rendering the cells more vulnerable to both apoptosis and necrosis (Wang and Qin, 2010).

Metal-induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction
Mitochondria are an important site of Ca2+ regulation and storage, taking up Ca2+ ions electrophoretically from the cytosol through a Ca2+ uniporter, which can then accumulate in the mitochondria (Roos et al., 2012; Orrenius et al., 2015). Similarities between calcium and metals, such as cadmium and lead, makes the entrance and accumulation of these metals into the mitochondria via calcium metals possible by mode of molecular mimicry (Mathews et al., 2013; Adiele et al., 2012). The outer mitochondrial membrane also contains the divalent metal transporter (DMT1), which allows for mitochondrial uptake of divalent metals such as Fe and Mn. When cells are under heavy metal-induced stress, DMT has been shown to be overexpressed in the mitochondrial membrane, making the mitochondria targets of metal toxicity and accumulation.

Heavy metal exposure in aerobic organisms increases ROS formation through redox cycling, where metals with different valence states (Fe, Cu, Cr, etc.) directly produce ROS as they are reduced by cellular antioxidants and then react with oxygen (Shaki et al., 2012; Shaki et al., 2013; Pourahmad et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2007). The production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals under mitochondrial oxidative stress and in the presence of transition metals occurs via the Fenton reaction or Haber-Weiss reaction (Hancock et al., 2001; Valko et al., 2005; Adam-Vizi et al., 2010). Metals and ROS are capable of damaging mitochondrial DNA as well as mechanisms of DNA repair and proliferation arrest (Valko et al., 2005). Metals and ROS have the potential to directly damage mitochondrial membranes and structure by binding to and oxidizing membrane lipids and proteins. This structural damage can collapse the MMP and lead to the opening of the MPTP (Orrenius et al., 2015; Roos et al., 2012; Pourahmad et al., 2006). Uranium and mercury, for example, have both been shown to directly inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain and interfere with ATP production (Shaki et al., 2012; Roos et al., 2012). Furthermore, as previously mentioned, metals have been shown to inhibit ROS-detoxifying enzymes. By binding to these enzymes, metals can inhibit their antioxidant functions, and cause an accumulation of ROS and increased synthesis of more antioxidant enzymes in order to combat the oxidative stress (Blajszczak and Bonini, 2017).

Summing up: Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cell survival and cell death because they are regulators of both energy metabolism and apoptotic/necrotic pathways (Fiskum, 2000; Wieloch, 2001; Friberg and Wieloch, 2002). The production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation is a vital mitochondrial function (Kann and Kov&aacute;cs, 2007; Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012). The ATP is continuously required for signalling processes (e.g. Ca2+ signalling), maintenance of ionic gradients across membranes, and biosynthetic processes (e.g. protein synthesis, heme synthesis or lipid and phospholipid metabolism) (Kang and Pervaiz, 2012), and (Green, 1998; McBride et al., 2006). Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration contributes to various cellular stress responses, such as deregulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis (Graier et al., 2007) and ROS production (Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012; reviewed Mei et al., 2013).). It is well established in the existing literature that mitochondrial dysfunction may result in: (a) an increased ROS production and a decreased ATP level, (b) the loss of mitochondrial protein import and protein biosynthesis, (c) the reduced activities of enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the Krebs cycle, (d) the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, (e) the loss of mitochondrial motility, causing a failure to re-localize to the sites with increased energy demands (f) the destruction of the mitochondrial network, and (g) increased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, causing Ca2+ overload (reviewed in Lin and Beal, 2006; Graier et al., 2007), (h) the rupture of the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, leading to (i) the release of mitochondrial pro-death factors, including cytochrome c (Cyt. c), apoptosis-inducing factor, or endonuclease G (Braun, 2012; Martin, 2011; Correia et al., 2012; Cozzolino et al., 2013), which eventually leads to apoptotic, necrotic or autophagic cell death (Wang and Qin, 2010). Due to their structural and functional complexity, mitochondria present multiple targets for various compounds."

Among the different forms of estrogens, 17&beta;-estradiol (E2) is considered the most fundamental in gonad differentiation in most vertebrates, as it is responsible for inducing and maintaining ovarian development (Bondesson et al. 2015; Li et al. 2019).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1791","Increased, Male Biased Sex Ratio","KE 1791","Sex ratio is the ratio of males to females in a population. A male-biased sex ratio for a given species is defined as a significant increase in the number of males, relative to the average ratio found in most populations of that species. 

While simple in concept, the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; sex ratio for a given species can be challenging to define.


	In organisms with genetic sex determination (GSD) such as mammals and birds, as well as many poikilothermic vertebrates, the male to female ratio often is 1:1. In these instances it is easy to define a deviation from normal in terms of either a relatively greater number of males or females.
	When considering organisms with environmental sex determination (ESD), such as many reptiles and some amphibians and fish, deviations from a 1:1 relationship can and do occur that nonetheless may be normal in the context of the organism&rsquo;s life history. For example, some reptile species have temperature-dependent sex determination where differentiation of developing organisms to males versus females predominates at different temperatures (Norris and Carr 2020).
	Further complicating a generalized definition of normal sex ratios are situations where sexual differentiation is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental variables, such is the case in many fish species.


Even in species potentially requiring fewer males than females to maintain a viable population, at some point a female-biased population could become problematic in terms of having an adequate number of males to fertilize eggs produced by females or, in the longer term, ensure a robust level of genetic diversity in a population. Further, in situations where a population is male-biased relative to conditions considered normal for a given species, overall productivity may be negatively impacted due to fewer females being available to produce eggs. 

A variety of external factors can produce populations that would be characterized as abnormally male-biased based on analysis of phenotypic sex ratios (examples, not comprehensive):


	Differential mortality can occur in males versus females. This might include situations where predation or harvest techniques geared toward larger individuals, which could be either males or females depending upon species may effectively skew the apparent male to female ratio higher. 
	Endocrine disruption during early development, most prominently, during gonadal differentiation. For example, in some fish species, exposure during gonadal differentiation to androgen receptor agonists or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 19a1 (aromatase), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of 17&beta;-estradiol, can caused male-biased populations (Delbes et al. 2022)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/18","Activation, AhR","KE 18","The AHR Receptor

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) superfamily and consists of three domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD), ligand binding domain (LBD) and transactivation domain (TAD)[1]. Other members of this superfamily include the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), which acts as a dimerization partner of the AHR [2][3]; Per, a circadian transcription factor; and Sim, the &ldquo;single-minded&rdquo; protein involved in neuronal development [4][5]. This group of proteins shares a highly conserved PAS domain and is involved in the detection of and adaptation to environmental change[4].

Investigations of invertebrates possessing early homologs of the AhR suggest that the AhR evolutionarily functioned in regulation of the cell cycle, cellular proliferation and differentiation, and cell-to-cell communications (Hahn et al 2002). However, critical functions in angiogenesis, regulation of the immune system, neuronal processes, metabolism, development of the heart and other organ systems, and detoxification have emerged sometime in early vertebrate evolution (Duncan et al., 1998; Emmons et al., 1999; Lahvis and Bradfield, 1998).

The molecular Initiating Event




Figure 1: The molecular mechanism of activation of gene expression by AHR.

 



The molecular mechanism for AHR-mediated activation of gene expression is presented in Figure 1. In its unliganded form, the AHR is part of a cytosolic complex containing heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the HSP90 co-chaperone p23 and AHR-interacting protein (AIP)[6]. Upon ligand binding, the AHR migrates to the nucleus where it dissociates from the cytosolic complex and forms a heterodimer with ARNT[7]. The AHR-ARNT complex then binds to a xenobiotic response element (XRE) found in the promoter of an AHR-regulated gene and recruits co-regulators such as CREB binding protein/p300, steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) 1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and nuclear receptor interacting protein 1, leading to induction or repression of gene expression[6]. Expression levels of several genes, including phase I (e.g. cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, CYP1B, CYP2A) and phase II enzymes (e.g. uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)), as well as genes involved in cell proliferation (transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1 beta), cell cycle regulation (p27, jun-B) and apoptosis (Bax), are regulated through this mechanism [6][8][7][9].

AHR Isoforms


	Over time the AhR has undergone gene duplication and diversification in vertebrates, which has resulted in multiple clades of AhR, namely AhR1, AhR2, and AhR3 (Hahn 2002).
	Fishes and birds express AhR1s and AhR2s, while mammals express a single AhR that is homologous to the AhR1 (Hahn 2002; Hahn et al 2006).
	The AhR3 is poorly understood and known only from some cartilaginous fishes (Hahn 2002).
	Little is known about diversity of AhRs in reptiles and amphibians (Hahn et al 2002).
	In some taxa, subsequent genome duplication events have further led to multiple isoforms of AhRs in some species, with up to four isoforms of the AhR (&alpha;, &beta;, &delta;, &gamma;) having been identified in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (Hansson et al 2004).
	Although homologs of the AhR have been identified in some invertebrates, compared to vertebrates these AhRs have differences in binding of ligands in the species investigated to date (Hahn 2002; Hahn et al 1994).


 

Roles of isoforms in birds:

Two AHR isoforms (AHR1 and AHR2) have been identified in the black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)[10]. AHR1 mRNA levels were similar in the kidney, heart, lung, spleen, brain, gonad and intestine from the great cormorant but were lower in muscle and pancreas. AHR2 expression was mainly observed in the liver, but was also detected in gonad, brain and intestine. AHR1 levels represented a greater proportion (80%) of total AHR levels than AHR2 in the cormorant liver[10], and while both AHR isoforms bound to TCDD, AHR2 was less effective at inducing TCDD-dependent transactivation compared to AHR1 in black-footed albatross, great cormorant and domestic chicken[11][10].


	AhR1 and AhR2 both bind and are activated by TCDD in vitro (Yasui et al 2007).
	AhR1 has greater binding affinity and sensitivity to activation by TCDD relative to AhR2 (Yasui et al 2007).
	AhR1 is believed to mediate toxicities of DLCs, while AhR2 has no known role in toxicities (Farmahin et al 2012; Farmahin et al 2013; Manning et al 2012).


Roles of isoforms in fishes:


	AhR1 and AhR2 both bind and are activated by TCDD in vitro (Bak et al 2013; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Karchner et al 1999; 2005).
	AhR1 has greater sensitivity to activation by TCDD than AhR2 in red seabream (Pagrus major), white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) (Bak et al 2013; Doering et al 2014; 2015)
	AhR2 has greater binding affinity or activation by TCDD than AhR1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) (Karchner et al 1999; 2005).
	AhR2 is believed to mediate toxicities in fishes, while AhR1 has no known role in toxicities. Specifically, knockdown of AhR2 protects against toxicities of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), while knockdown of AhR1 offers no protection (Clark et al 2010; Prasch et al 2003; Van Tiem &amp; Di Giulio 2011).


Roles of isoforms in amphibians and reptiles:


	Less is known about AhRs of amphibians or reptiles.
	AhR1 is believed to mediate toxicities in amphibians (Hahn 2002; Lavine et al 2005; Oka et al 2016; Shoots et al 2015). However, all AhRs of amphibians that have been investigated have very low affinity for TCDD (Hahn 2002; Lavine et al 2005; Oka et al 2016; Shoots et al 2015).
	Both AhR1s and AhR2 of American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) are activated by agonists with comparable sensitivities (Oka et al 2016). AhRs of no other reptiles have been investigated."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1800","Granulosa cell proliferation of gonadotropin-independent follicles, Reduced","KE 1800","Granulosa cell function

Granulosa cells of the ovary play an important structural and functional role during folliculogenesis. They form the ovarian follicle architecture and transmit molecular messages to the oocyte through gap junction channels, ensuring developmental competence(Kidder and Vanderhyden, 2010). Folliculogenesis can be roughly divided into two phases: gonadotropin-independent and gonadotropin-dependent by the requirement for the gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to grow(Hsueh et al., 2015). During the gonadotropin-independent growth phase, growth factors secreted by the follicle, e.g. growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF9) by the oocyte and anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) by the granulosa cells control the necessary morphological changes of granulosa cells and their proliferation(Hsueh et al., 2015). The growth can be histologically observed as proliferation of the granulosa cells as the flat granulosa cells of primordial follicles become cuboidal and increase in numbers(Gougeon, 2010). The connection between granulosa cell numbers and follicle growth during gonadotropin-independent growth is well described (Gougeon and Chainy, 1987).

 

Reduced granulosa cell proliferation as Key Event

Genetically modified mouse models have demonstrated that granulosa cell proliferation is a prerequisite for normal follicle growth and fertility. For example, deletion of the oocyte-specific growth factor GDF9 that stimulates granulosa cells halt folliculogenesis at the primary follicle stage in mice: the granulosa cells fail to proliferate to generate secondary follicles, the oocytes degenerate, and the mice are sterile(Dong et al., 1996). Conversely, mice administered GDF9 have accelerated granulosa cell proliferation and higher numbers of primary and secondary follicles compared to non-treated ones(Vitt et al., 2000).

AMH is a growth factor secreted by granulosa cells during the gonadotropin-independent follicle growth stage, and it inhibits the activation of primordial follicles to keep the growing and dormant follicles in balance. In mice overexpressing AMH, follicle growth to antral stages is inhibited and the numbers of all developmental stages of follicles decline faster by age than in wildtype controls(Pankhurst et al., 2018). Exposure of human ovarian tissue to AMH in culture inhibits follicle growth(Carlsson et al., 2006)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1822","Maturation of TNF/iNOS-Producing Dendritic Cells","KE 1822","Monocytes are formed in the bone marrow and continuously enter the blood circulation, where they constitute 10% of the total leukocyte population in humans (Sprangers et al. 2016). They are recruited to inflammatory sites and differentiate into immature dendritic cells in situ (Tang-Huau and Segura. 2019). These immature dendritic cells, known as monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DC) are distinguished from conventional or classical DCs which arise from a common DC precursor (Guilliams et al. 2014). They possess typical DC functions of antigen-presenting cells, including the ability to efficiently stimulate naive T cells and the capacity to express CCR7, and potentially enabling their migration to lymph nodes (Tang-Huau and Segura. 2019).

Mo-DC are HLA-DR+CD11c+CD14intCD206+CD1c+ cells. By contrast, they lack the macrophage markers CD16 and CD163. They also display a typical DC morphology: they are small size, possess dendrites and lack large cytoplasmic vacuoles (Tang-Huau and Segura. 2019). Human mo-DC are present in lungs, intestine and peritoneum in the steady-state. Peritoneal mo-DC secrete IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta; and IL-12p70 upon ex vivo re-stimulation. Mo-DC from bronchoalveolar lavage also secrete TNF-&alpha; upon re-stimulation (Tang-Huau and Segura. 2019).

Pathogen-derived components, such as Toll-like receptor ligands as well as inflammatory mediators induce maturation of mo-DC. These stimulants include LPS, ssRNA, IFN-&alpha;, TNF-&alpha;, IFN-&gamma; or CD40L (Le&oacute;n et al. 2005, Farkas and Kem&eacute;ny. 2011). TNF-&alpha; and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-producing DCs (Tip-DCs) are abundant in inflamed tissue such as skin in patients of chronic inflammatory skin disease, and not present in the steady-state or normal skin tissue. These cells are derived from monocyte infiltrated during inflammation and contribute to innate immune response to pathogens including bacteria and parasites (Guilliams et al. 2014).

From the above, monocyte is considered to infiltrate into inflammatory site and differentiate to mo-DC and Tip-DC, sequentially in chronically inflamed tissue. This maturation process is induced and/or promoted by IFN-&alpha;, TNF-&alpha; and GM-CSF (Farkas and Kem&eacute;ny. 2011).

Tip-DCs express HLA-DR, CD40, CD86, as well as maturation markers DC-Lamp and CD83 but lack the CD207/Langerin and CD14 markers of Langerhans cells and monocytes. In addition, Tip-DCs found in psoriasis produce the inflammatory mediators IL-8, IL-1, STAT1, CCL 20, IL-20, IL-23p19, and IL-12/IL-23p40, which mediate Th1 and Th17 responses (Wilsmann-Theis et al. 2013)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1825","Increase, Cell death","KE 1825","Cell death is part of normal development and maturation cycle, and is the component of many response patterns of living tissues to xenobiotic agents (i.e.. microorganisms and chemicals) and to endogenous modulations, such as inflammation and disturbed blood supply (Kanduc et al., 2002). Many physiological processes require cell death for their function (e.g.., embryonal development and immune selection of B and T cells) (Bertheloot et al., 2021). Defects in cells that result in their inappropriate survival or untimely death can negatively impact development or contribute to a variety of human pathologies, including cancer, AIDS, autoimmune disorders, and chronic infection. Cell death may also occur following exposure to environmental toxins or cytotoxic chemicals. Although this is often harmful, it can be beneficial in some cases, such as in the treatment of cancer (Crowley et al., 2016).  

Cell death can be divided into: programmed cell death (cell death as a normal component of development) and non-programmed cell death (uncontrolled death of the cell). Although this simplistic view has blurred the intricate mechanisms separating these forms of cell death, studies have and will uncover new effectors, cell death pathways and reveal a more complex and intertwined landscape of processes involving cell death (Bertheloot et al., 2021). 

Programmed cell death: is a form of cell death in which the dying cell plays an active part in its own demise (Cotter &amp; Al-Rubeai, 1995). 

Apoptosis At a morphological level, it is characterized by cell shrinkage rather than the swelling seen in necrotic cell death. It is characterized by a number of characteristic morphological changes in the structure of the cell, together with a number of enzyme‐dependent biochemical processes. The result of it being the clearance of cells from the body, with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. An essential feature of apoptosis is the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, regulated by a balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family, initiator caspases (caspase-8, -9 and -10) and effector caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7). Apoptosis culminates in the breakdown of the nuclear membrane by caspase-6, the cleavage of many intracellular proteins (e.g., PARP and lamin), membrane blebbing, and the breakdown of genomic DNA into nucleosomal structures (Bertheloot et al., 2021). Mechanistically, two main pathways contribute to the caspase activation cascade downstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release:  


	
	Intrinsic pathway is triggered by dysregulation of or imbalance in intracellular homeostasis by toxic agents or DNA damage. It is characterized by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. 
	



	
	Extrinsic pathway is initiated by activation of cell surface death receptors. Proapoptotic death receptors include TNFR1/2, Fas and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors DR4 and DR5. 
	


Other pathways of programmed cell death are called &raquo;non-apoptotic programmed cell-death&laquo; or &raquo;caspase-independent programmed cell-death&laquo; (Blank &amp; Shiloh, 2007). 

Necroptosis: This type of regulated cell death, occurs following the activation of the tumour necrosis receptor (TNFR1) by TNF&alpha;. Activation of other cellular receptors triggers necroptosis. These receptors include death receptors (i.e., Fas/FasL), Toll-like receptors (TLR4 and TLR3) and cytosolic nucleic acid sensors such as RIG-I and STING, which induce type I interferon (IFN-I) and TNF&alpha; production and thus promote necroptosis in an autocrine feedback loop. Most of these pathways trigger NF&kappa;B- dependent proinflammatory and prosurvival signals.  

Pyroptosis is a type of cell death culminating in the loss of plasma membrane integrity and induced by activation of so-called inflammasome sensors. These include the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, the DNA receptor Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Pyrin receptor. 

Autophagy: is a process where cellular components such as macro proteins or even whole organelles are sequestered into lysosomes for degradation (Mizushima et al., 2008; Shintani &amp; Klionsky, 2004). The lysosomes are then able to digest these substrates, the components of which can either be recycled to create new cellular structures and/or organelles or alternatively can be further processed and used as a source of energy (D&rsquo;Arcy, 2019). 

Anoikis is apoptosis induced by loss of attachment to substrate or to other cells (anoikis). Anoikis overlaps with apoptosis in molecular terms, but is classified as a separate entity because of its specific form of induction (Blank &amp; Shiloh, 2007). Induction of anoikis occurs when cells lose attachment to ECM, or adhere to an inappropriate type of ECM, the latter being the more relevant in vivo (Gilmore, 2005). 

Cornification: is programmed cell death of keratinocytes. Cell death in the context of cornification involves distinct enzyme classes such as transglutaminases, proteases, DNases and others (Eckhart et al., 2013). 

Non-programmed cell death: occurs accidentally in an unplanned manner. 

Necrosis is generally characterized to be the uncontrolled death of the cell, usually following a severe insult, resulting in the spillage of the contents of the cell into surrounding tissues and subsequent damage thereof (D&rsquo;Arcy, 2019)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1841","Encephalitis","KE 1841","Encephalitis by definition is an inflammation of the brain tissue, most commonly caused by viral infections, and in some rare cases it can be caused by bacteria or even fungi. There are two main types of encephalitis: primary and secondary, with primary occurring when a virus directly infects the brain and the spinal cord. On the other hand, secondary encephalitis as a consequence of an infection occurring elsewhere in the body that then spread to the brain (Johnson, 2018).

Several causes may cause encephalitis, but the most common is a viral infection, and can be characterized by mild or severe flu-like symptoms, possibly causing confused thinking, seizures, or problems with movement or with senses, such as sight or hearing. In some cases, encephalitis can be life-threatening, and for this reason timely diagnosis and treatment are essential (Mayo, 2021).

Viral encephalitis refers to inflammatory lesions in the brain parenchyma caused by pathogens, including neuronal damage and nerve tissue lesions. It is characterized by acute onset, and common symptoms include headache, fever (mainly high fever), vomiting, convulsions, and consciousness disorders (Ellul and Solomon, 2018). 

Encephalitis in the context of COVID19 

Among various neurological adverse outcomes, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can cause encephalitis (Moriguchi T et al. 2020; Efe et al. 2020; Najjar et al. 2020; Wu and Tang 2020; Bohmwald K, et al. 2020; Tsai LK et al. 2005; Xiang P. et al., 2020; Pilotto A et al. 2019; Ye M., et al. 2020; Das G, et al. 2020). Indeed, meningitis/meningoencephalitis has been observed in COVID19 patients (Iaconetta G et al. 2020). For instance, Moriguchi et al. have described SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis in a 24-year old man, 10 days after developing COVID19 symptoms, characterized by headache, fatigue, fever, and consciousness disturbance, and with MRI showing hyperintense signal changes in the hippocampus with slight hippocampal atrophy (Moriguchi T et al. 2020).

Early diagnosis of viral encephalitis is critical. In the ongoing pneumonia epidemic, the treatment team of Beijing Ditan Hospital confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid of patients with COVID-19 by genome sequencing, thereby clinically verifying viral encephalitis (Xiang et al., 2020). This provided a solid basis for CoV causing encephalitis.

CSF of COVID19 patients with encephalitis/meningoencephalitis often shows pleocytosis and elevated total protein and NfL levels (Esp&iacute;ndola et al. 2020) (Koralnik et al. 2020).

In SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with neurological manifestations, CSF pleocytosis is associated with para- or post-infectious encephalitis and polyradiculitis. Anti-GD1b and anti-Caspr2 autoantibodies can be identified in certain cases, raising the question of SARS-CoV-2-induced secondary autoimmunity (Guilmot et al., 2020).

Intracranial inoculation of murine coronavirus (mouse hepatic virus, MHV), induces optic neuritis and focal encephalitis leading to chronic demyelination in mice (Shindler KS, et al. 2008). 

SARS-CoV responsible for the 2002&ndash;2004 outbreak was reported to induce encephalitis, along with polyneuropathy and ischemic stroke (Tsai et al. 2005). 

Autopsy results of patients with SARS showed ischemic neuronal damage and demyelination. Viral RNA was detected in brain tissue, particularly accumulating in and around the hippocampus (Gu J, et al. 2005)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1845","Coagulation","KE 1845","Coagulation is a process that responds to injury by the rapid formation of a clot. Activation of coagulation factor proteins are involved in coagulation.  In the extrinsic pathway, platelets, upon the contact with collagen in the injured blood vessel wall, release thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and adenosine 2 phosphates (ADP), leading to the clot formation. Extravascular tissue factor (TF) binds to plasma factor VIIa (FVIIa) and promotes the activation of FXa. Activated FXa assembles with cofactors FVa and FVIIIa on the surface of aggregated platelets, which lead to generation of thrombin (FIIa). Thrombin catalyzes the production of fibrin (FG) which creates a clot.
The binding of prekallikrein and high-molecular weight kininogen activate FXIIa in the intrinsic pathway.
Many regulators are involved in coagulation system. Plasmin is one of the modulators required for dissolution of the fibrin clot. Plasmin is activated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activation (uPA). SERPINs inhibit thrombin, plasmin and tPA. For example, SERPINE1 or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) inhibits tPA/uPA and results in hypofibrinolysis [Bernard I,et al. Viruses. 2021; 13(1):29.]. In addition, SERPING1 inhibits FXII, and thus down-regulation of SERPING1 lifts suppression of FXII of the intrinsic coagulation cascade [Garvin et al. eLife 2020;9:e59177]. Protein C, protein S and thrombomodulin degrade FVa and FVIIIa. [Ref. IPA, Coagulation System, version60467501, release date: 2020-11-19]"
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1846","Thrombosis and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation","KE 1846","Thrombosis is defined as the formation or presence of a thrombus. Clotting within a blood vessel may cause infarction of tissues supplied by the vessel. Extreme aggravation of blood coagulation induces multiple thrombi in the microvasculature, which leads to consumption coagulopathy followed by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

DIC is a pathological syndrome resulting from the formation of thrombin, subsequent activation and consumption of coagulation proteins, and the production of fibrin thrombi. The initial pathologic events are thrombotic in nature resulting in thrombotic vascular occlusions.  The initial clinical events are usually hemorrhagic resulting in oozing from mucosa and massive gastrointestinal blood loss. The occlusive events occur as a result of fibrin microthrombi or platelet microthrombi that obstruct the microcirculation of organs. This obstruction can result in organ hypoperfusion and ischemia, infarction, and necrosis. All organs are potentially vulnerable to the effects of thrombotic occlusions.

The renal effects of DIC are multifactorial and may be associated with hypovolemia or hypotension. If the hypotension is not corrected it may lead to renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis. Fibrin thrombi may also block glomerular capillaries causing ischemic, renal cortical necrosis (Colman, 1984).

The cerebral effects of DIC often result in nonspecific changes such as altered state of consciousness, convulsions, and coma. Major vascular occlusions, subarachnoid hemorrhage, multiple cortical and brain stem hemorrhages may occur following microvascular occlusions (Schwartzman RJ, 1982).

The pulmonary effects of DIC may be caused by interstitial hemorrhage resulting in a clinical effect resembling acute respiratory distress syndrome (Schwartzman RJ,1973; Shahl RL, 1984)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1847","Increased SARS-CoV-2 production","KE 1847","This KE1847 &quot;Increase coronavirus production&quot; deals with how the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is translated, replicated, and transcribed in detail, and how the genomic RNA (gRNA) is packaged, and the virions are assembled and released from the cell. 

Coronavirus is a class of viruses that have single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes in their envelopes [D. Kim et al.]. The virus contains a 29.7 kB positive-sense RNA genome flanked by 5&#39; and 3&#39; untranslated regions of 265 and 342 nucleotides, respectively [E. J. Snijder et al.] that contain cis-acting secondary RNA structures essential for RNA synthesis [N. C. Huston et al.]. The genome just prior to the 5&prime; end contains the transcriptional regulatory sequence leader (TRS-L) [C.J. Budzilowicx et al.]. The SARS-CoV genome is polycistronic and contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) that are expressed by poorly understood mechanisms [E. J. Snijder et al.]. Preceding each ORF there are other TRSs called the body TRS (TRS B). The 5&prime; two-thirds of the genome contains two large, overlapping, nonstructural ORFs and the 3&prime; third contains the remainder ORFs [H. Di et al.]. Genome expression starts with the translation of two large ORFs of the 5&rsquo; two-thirds: ORF1a of 4382 amino acids and ORF1ab of 7073 amino acid that occurs via a programmed (- 1) ribosomal frameshifting [E. J. Snider et al.], yielding pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins are cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases encoded by ORF1a, nsp3, and nsp5 that contain a papain-like protease domain and a 3C-like protease domain [M. D. Sacco et al.]. The processing products are a group of replicative enzymes, named nsp1-nsp16, that assemble into a viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) associated with membranes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the help of various membrane-associated viral proteins [S. Klein et al., E. J. Snijder et al., P. V&#39;Kovski, et al.]. Besides replication, which yields the positive-sense gRNA, the replicase also mediates transcription leading to the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs to express all ORFs downstream of ORF1b that encode structural and accessory viral proteins. These localize to the 3&prime; one-third of the genome, as stated above, and result in a 3&prime; coterminal nested set of 7&ndash;9 mRNAs that share ~70&ndash;90 nucleotide (nt) in the 5&prime; leader and that is identical to the 5&prime; end of the genome [P. Liu, and J. Leibowitz]. sgRNAs encode conserved structural proteins (spike protein [S], envelope protein [E], membrane protein [M], and nucleocapsid protein [N]), and several accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 is known to have at least six accessory proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10). Overall the virus is predicted to express 29 proteins [D. Kim et al.]. The gRNA is packaged by the structural proteins to assemble progeny virions.

Viral translation:

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of ~30 kb, sequence orientation in a 5&rsquo; to 3&rsquo; direction typical of positive sense and reflective of the resulting mRNA [D. Kim et al.]. The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a 5&rsquo;-untranslated region (UTR; 265 bp), ORF1ab (21,289 bp) holding two overlapping open reading frames (13,217 bp and 21,289 bp, respectively) that encode two polyproteins [D. Kim et al.]. Other elements of the genome include are shown below [V. B. O&#39;Leary et al.]. The first event upon cell entry is the primary translation of the ORF1a and ORF1b gRNA to produce non-structural proteins (nsps).

This is completely dependent on the translation machinery of the host cell. Due to fewer rare &ldquo;slow-codons&rdquo;, SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher protein translational rate, and therefore higher infectivity compared to other coronavirus groups [V. B. O&#39;Leary et al.]. The ORF1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 440&ndash;500 kDa) that is cleaved into nsp-1 through nsp-11. A -1 ribosome frameshift occurs immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, to allow translation through ORF1b, yielding 740&ndash;810 kDa polypeptide pp1ab, which is cleaved into 15 nsps [D. Kim et al.]. Two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, generate continuous polypeptides, which are cleaved into a total of 16 so-called nsps [Y Finkel et al.]. Functionally, there are five proteins from pp1ab (nsp-12 through nsp-16) as nsp-1-11 are duplications of the proteins in pp1a due to the ORF overlap. The pp1a is approximately 1.4&ndash;2.2 times more expressed than pp1ab. After translation, the polyproteins are cleaved by viral proteases nsp3 and nsp5. Nsp5 protease can be referred to as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) or as main protease (Mpro), as it cleaves the majority of the polyprotein cleavage sites. [H.A. Hussein et al.] Nsp1 cleavage is quick and nsp1 associates with host cell ribosomes and results in host cellular shutdown, suppressing host gene expression [M. Thoms et al.]. Fifteen proteins, nsp2&ndash;16 constitute the viral RTC. They are targeted to defined subcellular locations and establish a network with host cell factors. Nsp2&ndash;11 remodel host membrane architecture, mediate host immune evasion and provide cofactors for replication, whilst nsp12&ndash;16 contain the core enzymatic functions involved in RNA synthesis, modification and proofreading [P. V&#39;Kovski et al.].  nsp-7 and nsp-8 form a complex priming the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or RTC) - nsp-12. nsp14 provides a 3&prime;&ndash;5&prime; exonuclease activity providing RNA proofreading function. Nsp-10 composes the RNA capping machinery nsp-9. nsp13 provides the RNA 5&prime;-triphosphatase activity. Nsp-14 is a N7-methyltransferase and nsp-16 the 2&prime;-O-methyltransferase. Many of the nsps have multiple functions and many viral proteins are involved in innate immunity inhibition. Nsp-3 is involved in vesicle formation along with nsp-4 and nsp-6 where viral replication occurs. Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human RNAs thwart the IFN response upon infection: nsp-16 binds to U1 and U2 splicing RNAs to suppress global mRNA splicing; nsp-1 binds to 40S ribosomal RNA in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome to inhibit host mRNA translation; nsp-8 and nsp-9 bind to the 7SL RNA to block protein trafficking to the cell membrane [A. K. Banerjee et al.]. Xia et al. [H. Xia et al.] found that nsp-6 and nsp-13 antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: nsp-6 binds TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, and nsp-13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation.

 

Viral transcription and replication:

Viral transcription and replication occur at the viral replication organelle (RO) [E. J. Snijder et al.]. The RO is specifically formed during infection by reshaping ER and other membranes, giving rise to small spherular invaginations, and large vesiculotubular clusters, consisting of single- and/or double-membrane vesicles (DMV), convoluted membranes (CM) and double-membrane spherules invaginating from the ER  [S. Klein et al., E. J. Snijder et al.]. There is some evidence that DMV accommodate viral replication which is based on radiolabelling viral RNA with nucleoside precursor ([5-3[H]uridine) and detection by EM autoradiography [E. J. Snijder et al.].

Viral replicative proteins and specific host factors are recruited to ROs [E. J. Snijder et al.]. RNA viral genome is transcribed into messenger RNA by the viral RTC [P. Ahlquist et al.]. Viral RTC act in combination with other viral and host factors involved in selecting template RNAs, elongating RNA synthesis, differentiating genomic RNA replication from mRNA transcription, modifying product RNAs with 5&rsquo; caps or 3&rsquo; polyadenylate [P. Ahlquist et al.]. Positive-sense (messenger-sense) RNA viruses replicate their genomes through negative-strand RNA intermediates [M. Schwartz et al.]. The intermediates comprise full-length negative-sense complementary copies of the genome, which functions as templates for the generation of new positive-sense gRNA, and a nested set of sg mRNAs that lead to the expression of proteins encoded in all ORFs downstream of ORF1b. The transcription of coronaviruses is a discontinuous process that produces nested 3&prime; and 5&prime; co-terminal sgRNAs. Of note, the synthesis of sg mRNAs is not exclusive to the order Nidovirales but a discontinuous minus-strand synthesis strategy to produce a nested set of 3&prime; co-terminal sg mRNAs with a common 5&prime; leader in infected cells are unique features of the coronaviruses and arteriviruses [W. A. Miller and G. Koev.]. Of note, the produced genomic RNA represents a small fraction of the total vRNA [N. S. Ogando et al.].

The discontinuous minus-strand synthesis of a set of nested sg mRNAs happens during the synthesis of the negative-strand RNA, by an interruption mechanism of the RTC as it reads the TRS-B preceding each gene in the 3&prime; one-third of the viral genome [I. Sola, F. Almazan et al., I. Sola, J. L. Moreno, et al.]. The synthesis of the negative-strand RNA stops and is re-initiated at the TRS-L of the genome sequence close from the 5&prime; end of the genome [H. Di et al.]. Therefore, the mechanism by which the leader sequence is added to the 5&#39; end requires that the RTC switches template by a jumping mechanism. This interruption process involves the interaction between complementary TRSs of the nascent negative-strand RNA TRS-B and the positive-strand gRNA at the positive-sense TRS-L. The TRS-B site has a 7-8 bp conserved core sequence (CS) that facilitates RTC template switching as it hybridizes with a near complementary CS in the TRS-L [I. Sola, F. Almazan et al. I. Sola, J. L. Moreno, et al.]. Upon re-initiation of RNA synthesis at the TRS-L region, a negative-strand copy of the leader sequence is added to the nascent RNA to complete the synthesis of negative-strand sgRNAs. This means that all sg mRNAs as well as the genomic RNA share a common 5&#39; sequence, named leader sequence [X. Zhang et al.]. This programmed template switching leads to the generation of sg mRNAs with identical 5&#39; and 3&#39; sequences, but alternative central regions corresponding to the beginning of each structural ORF [I. Sola et al. 2015, S. G. Sawicki et al., Y. Yang et al.]. Of note, the existence of TRSs also raises the possibility that these sites are at the highest risk of recombining through TRS-B mediated template switching [Y. Yang]. The set of sg mRNAs is then translated to yield 29 identified different proteins [F. Wu et al.], although many papers have identified additional ORFs [D. Kim et al.. Y. Finkel et al., A. Vandelli et al.]. The translation of the linear single-stranded RNA conducts to the generation of the following proteome: 4 are structural proteins, S, N, M, and E; 16 proteins nsp: the first 11 are encoded in ORF1a whereas the last 5 are encoded in ORF1ab. In addition, 9 accessory proteins named ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF9c, and ORF10 have been identified [F. Wu et al.]. At the beginning of infection, there is the predominant expression of the nsp that result from ORF1a and ORF1ab, however, at 5 hpi, the proteins encoded by the 5&prime; last third are found in higher amounts, and the nucleoprotein is the protein found in higher levels [Y. Finkel et al.].

 

Viral assembly:

The final step of viral production requires virion assembly and this process is not well explored for SARS-CoV-2. For example, the role of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in virus assembly and budding in not known. In general, all beta-coronavirus structural proteins assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi compartment [J. R. Cohen et al., A. Perrier et al.] and viral assembly requires two steps: Genome packaging which is a process in which the SARS-CoV-2 gRNA must be coated by the viral protein nucleoprotein (N) protein, forming viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNPs) complexes, before being selectively packaged into progeny virions [P. V&#39;Kovski et al.], a step in which vRNPs bud into the lumen of the ER and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [N. S. Ogando et al.]. This results in viral particles enveloped with host membranes containing viral M, E, and S transmembrane structural proteins that need to be released from the cell. 

SARS-CoV-2 gRNA packaging involves the N protein. The N protein of human coronaviruses is highly expressed in infected cells. It is considered a multifunctional protein, promoting efficient sub-genomic viral RNA transcription, viral replication, virion assembly, and interacting with multiple host proteins [P. V&#39;Kovski et al., D. E. Gordon et al., R. McBride, and M. van Zyl, B. C.]. In relation to transcription and replication, the N protein could provide a cooperative mechanism to increase protein and RNA concentrations at specific localizations S. Alberti, and S. Carra, S. F. Banani et al.], and this way organize viral transcription. Five studies have shown that N protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro [A. Savastano et al., H. Chen et al., C. Iserman et al., T. M. Perdikari et al., J. Cubuk et al.], dependent on its C-terminal domain (CTD) [H. Chen et al.]. It has been hypothesised that N could be involved in replication close to the ER and in packaging of gRNA into vRNPs near the ERGIC where genome assembly is thought to take place [A. Savastano et al.], but so far this is still speculative. Phosphorylation of N could adjust the physical properties of condensates differentially in ways that could accommodate the two different functions of N: transcription and progeny genome assembly [A. Savastano et al., C. Iserman et al., C. R. Carlson et al.]. 

The ERGIC constitutes the main assembly site of coronaviruses [S. Klein et al., E. J. Snijder et al., L. Mendonca et al.] and budding events have been seen by EM studies. For SARS-CoV-2, virus-budding was mainly clustered in regions with a high vesicle density and close to ER- and Golgi-like membrane arrangements [S. Klein et al., E. J. Snijder et al., L. Mendonca et al.]. The ectodomain of S trimers were found facing the ERGIC lumen and not induce membrane curvature on its own, therefore proposing that vRNPs and spike trimers [S. Klein et al.]. 

Finally, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 virions de novo formed traffic to lysosomes for unconventional egress by Arl8b-dependent lysosomal exocytosis [S. Ghosh et al.]. This process results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation enzymes, and disruption of antigen presentation [S. Ghosh et al.]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1848","Toll Like Receptor (TLR) Dysregulation","KE 1848","Background

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of 13 conserved transmembrane receptors that are at the forefront of directing innate and adaptive immune responses against invading bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (Akira 2003, Takeda, Akira 2004, Pasare, Medzhitov 2005, Tal, Adini et al. 2020, van der Made, Simons et al. 2020). Upon activation TLRs initiate overlapping and distinct signaling pathways in various cell types such as macrophages (MP), conventinal DC (cDC), plasmacytoid DC (pDC), lamina propria DC (LPDC), and inflammatory monocytes (iMO). Engagement of TLR with specific stressors (e.g. PAMPs and DAMPs) induces conformational changes of TLRs that allow homo- or heterophilic interactions of TLRs and recruitment of adaptor proteins such as MyD88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM to control intracellular signalling pathways leading to the synthesis and secretion of appropriate cytokines and chemokines by cells of the immune system. TLRs have various biological roles both in pathogen combat and tissue homeostasis. 

This KE is first developed in context of COVID-19 CIAO project. 

The key gatekeepers in detecting and combating viral infections are TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 and these are predominantly localized in intracellular compartments. In the setting of COVID-19, multiple TLRs are likely relevant in viral combat. Literature covering TLR triggering via SARS-CoV-2 derived PAMPS (Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns) include:


	TLR7 and TLR8 (+TLR3, TLR4, TLR6)  (Khanmohammadi and Rezaei, 2021)
	TLR1, TLR4 and TLR6 activated by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (Choudhury A et al, 2020)
	TLR9: Less CpG suppression in coronavirus compared to other viruses, for SARS-CoV-2 in the Envelope (E) open reading frame (E-ORF) and ORF10 (Ng et al., 2004; Digard et al. 2020) and multidisciplinary links described in Bezemer and Garssen, 2021


TLR dysregulation can be multi-fold: 


	Underperformance of TLR function leading to poor pathogen combat. This is covered in AOP 378



	COVID-19 patients having poor TLR function (due to polymorphisms) could potentially have less viral clearance capability and more adverse events leading to more severe disease and mortality. This has been shown for TLR7 loss of function polymorphisms (van der Made et al 2020). Knowledge Gap: it is not known if loss of function of other TLRs has a worse outcome in COVID-19 patients.



	Overperformance of TLR function contributing to exaggerated immune response/cytokine storm/thrombosis/progression into ARDS and MOD. This is covered in AOP377



	TLR7 and TLR9 expression, measured by RNAseq gene analysis, is more elevated in black Americans than white Americans, which is proposed to explain in part the racial disparity in Covid-19 mortality rates via TLR mediated DC activation (Tal et al. 2020)
	genetic mutations leading to TLR9 gain of function in human is associated with immune-mediated disease and with a higher incidence of ICU acquired infection (Chatzietal.,2018;Ng et al.,2010).
	Higher presence of host derived TLR stressors in vulnerable patients can contribute to TLR overstimulation/dysregulation. (Bezemer and Garssen, 2021)


Different classes of &quot;stressors&quot; act on TLR activation/dysregulation




1.  Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLRs can sense PAMPS during infection or upon exposure to stressors containing micro-organisms or fragments thereof (e.g. cigarette smoke, bioaerosols, house dust mite)


	TLR1 is activated by bacterial Lipopeptides
	TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipoproteins and glycolipids, TLR2 can form conformations with TLR1 and TLR6 to distinguish between diacyl and triacyl lipopeptides.
	TLR3 is activated by viral double stranded RNA(dsRNA)
	TLR4 is activated by Bacterial LPS
	TLR5 is activated by Bacterial flagellig
	TLR6 is activated by Bacterial lipopeptides and Fungal zymosan
	TLR7 and 8 recognize viral single stranded RNA(ssRNA) and bacterial RNA. 
	TLR9 recognizes RNA and DNAmotifs that are rich in unmethylated Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sequences. CpG-motifs are higher expressed in the bacterial and viral genome compared to the vertebrate genome (Hemmi et al., 2000). 


2. host derived Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPS). Note that in the context and nomenclature of AOP these DAMPS cannot be labeld as &quot;stressors&quot; since they are derived from inside and not from outside, however these &quot;pseudostressors&quot; do act on the TLR receptors in similar way as PAMPs 


	
	TLR2 and TLR4 are activated by heat shock proteins 60 and 70  (HSP60 and HSP70); extracellular matrix components (ECM); oligosaccharides of hyaluronic acid (HA) and heparan sulfate (HS) (Piccinini AM and Midwood KS, 2010).
	
	
	high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) triggers TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9
	
	Oxidative injury/Oxidized phospholipids  triggers TLR4 mediated NET formation
	Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), evolutionary derived from endosymbiont bacteria, contains unmethylated CpG-motifs and triggers inflammatory responses directly via TLR9 during injury and/or infection (Zhang et al., 2010).
	Altered self-ligands, called carboxy-alkyl-pyrroleprotein adducts (CAPs), that are generated during oxidative stress, are known to aggravate TLR9/MyD88 pathway activation (Zhanget al., 2010;Panigrahi et al., 2013). CAPs have been shown to promote platelet activation, granule secretion, and aggregation in vitro and thrombosis in vivo (Panigrahi et al., 2013). 


3. synthetic TLR triggers/blockers (agonists/antagonists) for therapeutic purposes. Examples include CpG-ODNs triggering TLR9 for vaccin adjuvants/cancer treatment/immuno-modulation

 

Several Modulating factors can contribute to TLR activation/dysregulation


	Co-infection and Trauma (for instance ventilator induced damage) can induce increased levels of TLR9 stressor, mtDNA, which is known to drive worse outcome at ICU in setting of other disorders.  
	High levels of Visceral Fat, can increase TLR9 expression levels &aacute;nd circulating mtDNA
	Aging triggers both immunosenescence and inflammaging in part via impaired TLR function versus inappropriate triggering via increases of circulating DAMPS (Shaw et al 2011)
	Genetic polymorphisms can lead to TLR dysregulation (TLR9 gain of function and TLR7 loss of function with worse outcome at ICU Chatzi et al 2018, van der Made et al 2020, Chen et al 2011, )
	Circulating DAMPS such as mtDNA levels increase with age which is a familiar trait contributing to chronic inflammation, so called&ldquo;inflamm-aging&rdquo;in elderly people (Pinti et al., 2014).

ACE2 has multiple functions, and is highly regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. Modulation of the expression levels or functional activity of the ACE2 receptor is described in this KE. 

 ACE2 is bound to cell membranes, and in polarized cells it is exclusively targeted to the apical surface (Werner 2005; Ren 2006) [for more detailed description of the expression patterns of ACE2 see the applicability domain section]. 

 

ACE2 FUNCTIONS

Enzymatic function of ACE2 in interlinked bioactive peptide systems 

ACE2 is mainly known and studied as a type I ectoenzyme i.e. a transmembrane protein with an extracellular amino-terminal domain harbouring a carboxypeptidase active site.  ACE2 cleaves the carboxyterminal amino acid from a number of biologically active peptides (Figure 1 and 2), thus activating or deactivating them as agonists within the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) (Santos et al., 2019) and within the Kinin&ndash;kallikrein system (KKS) (Kakoki &amp; Oliver, 2009) in mammals. 

The extracellular domain of ACE2 can itself be cleaved (shedding) in vitro and in vivo, releasing a soluble and catalytically active sACE2 (Guy et al., 2008 in human cardiac myofibroblasts; Peng Jia et al., 2009 in human lung epithelial cells and BALF; Werner et al., 2005 in canine epithelial polarised kidney MDCKII cells stabilly expressing ACE2). Constitutive shedding of ACE2 from the cellular membrane is mediated by another membrane-bound metalloprotease from the adamalysin family, ADAM17 (Iwata et al., 2009) also known as TACE, TNFalpha Converting Enzyme (Zunke 2017).  Other proteins may also be involved in ACE2 protolithic modulation (Lambert et al, 2008). 

The exact role of ACE2 shedding in modulating its function is not well understood, however, being catalytically active, the released sACE2 can, as the membrane-anchored full length ACE2, generate biologically active peptides which activate specific receptors in different cells/tissues/organs. Thus, the ACE2 function in the organism is mediated via its peptide products activating specific receptors on the same, (autocrine), nearby (paracrine) and potentially distant cells. 

     

ACE2 is a homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), with whom it shares significant sequence similarity (Tipnis, 2000; Donoghue 2000), yet exhibits very distinct enzymatic activity. ACE2, as ACE, is a zink-metallopeptidase, however ACE2 is strictly a carboxypeptidase while ACE is an dipeptidase. Furthermore, the main substrate of ACE2 is the octopeptide Angiotensin II (Ang II), the enzymatic product of its homologue ACE. By cleaving a single amino acid from the C-terminus of Ang II, ACE2 generates a functionally different bioactive peptide Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7) (Figure 1). ACE2 is key to the regulation of local and systemic Ang II levels. 

Ultimately, the function of ACE2 at tissue level is mediated via the interaction of its main active product Ang1-7 with the Angiotensin II receptor 2 (AT2R), balanced by the activity of its homologue ACE and other peptidases in the RAS.

Although most studies have focused on the role of ACE2 in angiotensin metabolism in the RAS, the enzyme has broad substrate specificity and it also hydrolyses a number of other biologically active peptides including des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK), apelin-13, neurotensin(1&ndash;11), dynorphin A-1&ndash;13), &beta;-casomorphin-(1&ndash;7), and ghrelin (Vickers 2002, Humming, 2007.

ACE2 cleavage of DABK to bradykinin 1-7 (Figure 2) has been demonstrated in chemico (Donoghue 2000, Vickers 2002), with human polarised primary lung cells in vitro and in mice broncho-alveolar lavage (BALF) (Sodhi 2018). Deactivation of DBAK, a preferencial bradikynin receptor 1 (B1K) agonist (Coulson et al., 2019), is an important regulatory function of ACE2 in the KKS (Figure 2).

1.2   ACE2 chaperone function for transporters of amino acid transfer (B0AT1)

Somewhat less known is the RAS independent function of ACE2 in the gut, where it  regulates intestinal amino acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the gut microbiome (Camargo et al., 2020). ACE2 was identified as an important regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible susceptibility to colitis in mice (Hashimoto et al., 2012).  The mechanism by which ACE2 regulates amino acid transport in the intestine involves interaction with the broad neutral (0) amino acid transporter 1 (B0AT1) (Slc6a19) which mediates the uptake of neutral dietary amino acids, such as tryptophan and glutamine, into intestinal cells in a sodium-dependent manner (Camargo et al, 2009).   A crystal structure study revealed a complex dimer of ACE2/ B0AT1 heterodimers (Yan et al., 2020), previously suggested by immunoprecipitation of intestinal membrane proteins in mice (Fairweather et al., 2012). Immunofluorescence showed co-localization of B0AT1 with ACE2 at the luminal surface of human small intestine (Vuille-dit-Bille et al., 2015).  ACE2 seems to be necessary not only for the amino acid transfer by B0AT1, but also for its membrane expression (Camargo et al., 2008; Hashimoto et al., 2012). 

     REGULATION OF ACE2      LEVELS and ACTIVITY

ACE2 is regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level, the final potentially differing in the different organisational contexts: cell membrane versus tissue (plasma and/or interstitial). In addition, all of these regulatory processes may be differentially modulated in different tissues.

Age, sex and species specific differences in aspects of the regulation, and also tissue specific regulation, have been reported (reviewed in Saponaro 2020). 

Loss of function of ACE2 in vivo in ACE2 knockout (KO) mice has been associated with elevated levels of Ang II in heart, kidney and plasma as well as histological and functional perturbations in the lungs and in the cardiovascular (Crackower et al, Nature 2002) and renal (Oudit et al, 2010) systems, mostly in the presence of a particular stress factor, in some cases potentiated by aging (reviewed in Humming 2007). 

Furthermore, Ace2 KO mice exhibited reduced serum levels of tryptophan, together with downregulated expression of small intestinal antimicrobial peptides and altered gut microbiota, which was re-established by tryptophan supplementation (Hashimoto et a., 2012). 

 

At transcriptional level 

Overall, the transcriptional regulatory elements of the ace2 gene are not well characterised. 

Ace2, human but not mouse, was identified as an Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) in airway epithelial cells (Ziegler, 2020), indicating species specific regulation and its importance for human viral infections mediated via ACE2 (e.g. SARS-COV2). Influenza virus infection also induced ACE2 mRNA synthesis in human lung tissue (Ziegler, 2020).

In vitro in normal kidney tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) ACE2 mRNA is down-regulated following Ang II treatment (Koka 2008). The exact transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not clear, but the observed ACE2 mRNA up-regulation in this system appears to be mediated by the activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase pathway and dependent on the activation of AT1R receptor by AngII, as demonstrated by specific AT1R, MAP kinase and ERK1/2 MAP kinase inhibitors (Koka et al., 2008). Regulation of ACE2 expression mediated by AT1R activation is an important endogenous regulatory mechanism for ACE2 activity within the RAS system (ref&hellip;..).

Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) may also emerge as an ACE2 transcriptional regulator/repressor (Saponaro 2020 and Glinsky 2020, unreviewed pre-print). VDR has already been implicated in the transcriptional repression of Renin, at least in vitro (Yuan 2007). 

17b-estradiol (E2) has also been indicated in the transcriptional regulation of ace2 in a tissue specific manner (recently reviewed by Saponaro 2020). E2 down-regulated ace2 transcription particularly in kidney and differentiated airway epithelial cells. However, in human atrial tissue, E2 appeared to up-regulate ACE2 mRNA and protein. This change was associated with decreased levels of ACE homologue protein. The exact mechanism for this regulation remains to be elucidated as it may represent a significant modulating factor in the differential sex susceptibility to ACE2 dysregulation under varied stress conditions (e.g SARS-COV infection).

Epigenetic transcriptional regulation of ace2 has also been indicated (recently reviewed by Saponaro 2020. Transcription of ace2 is repressed by histone methylation and stimulated by NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 during cellular energy stress. Interestingly, in children ACE2 is normally hypermethylated and poorly expressed in the lung and in other organs (Saponaro 2020, ref therein).

Gut microbiota have also been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 expression in the gut (Yang et al., 2020) but also in the lung (Koester et al., 2021). Whether this is directly or indirectly occurring via microbial metabolites remains to be elucidated, but the study by Koester ar e al, 2020 observed variability in intestinal Ace2 expression in gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota, partially attributable to differences in microbiome-encoded proteases and peptidases.

At post-transcriptional level

Generally, modulation of ACE2 mRNA and protein levels appear to follow consistent pattern. However, it has been demonstrated that under certain conditions and in some tissues, mRNA and protein levels appear to follow a different pattern, suggesting important role of post-transcriptional or post-translational (see next section) regulation of ACE2 expression and function.

For example, hypertension in humans has been associated with different modulation of mRNA and protein levels in the heart tissue (Koka 2008). Specifically, heart tissue from patients with hypertension showed decreased levels of ACE2 mRNA while protein levels were comparable to normal tissue. In contrast, ACE mRNA and protein levels appeared consistently up-regulated in hart tissue of hypertensive patients (Koka 2008).  In the same study, in the kidney tissue from patients with hypertensive nephropathy, both, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels, appeared consistently down-regulated compared to normal kidney tissue (Koka 2008). Significant suppression of ACE2 mRNA and protein expression was also observed in vitro in normal kidney tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with AngII (linked to hypertension in vivo) in a dose and time dependent manner Koka 2008).  AngII treatment in vitro with myocardia- derived cells was not examined in this study and the discrepancy of mRNA and protein level modulation in the hypertensive human heart tissue biopsies was attributed by the authors to limitations of the detecting methods (Koka 2008). 

Clear discrepancy in the modulation of mRNA versus protein level has been observed in vivo in mice in myocardial tissue (Patel 2014).  Namely, up-regulation of mRNA synthesis was associated with down-regulation of ACE2 protein levels following 1 or 2 week treatment by exogenous circulating AngII (Patel 2014). In this study, down-regulation of ACE2 protein levels was alleviated by AT1R blockage/inhibitors, while mRNA up-regulation was not dependent on AT1R signalling. This strongly suggests involvement of post-transcriptional mechanism step(s) mediated by AngII/AT1R fot the regulation of ACE2 protein/function, at least in myocardial tissue under certain stress conditions. 

Modulation of ACE2 protein and activity levels by AngII is clinically relevant phenomenon and AngII activity blockers (ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers) are used to move the balance of the RAS from the ACE/AngII/AT1R axis towards the protective ACE2/Ang1-7/MasR axis. This is particularly relevant in the lung where ACE/ACE2 activity ratio is high (Roca-Ho, 2017-mice, human and other ref&hellip;&hellip;?..). 

The up-regulation of ACE2 mRNA observed in mouse myocardial tissue by Patel et al., 2014 appears contradictory to the finding of ACE2 mRNA down-regulation observed in the heart of hypertensive patients observed in the study of Koka et al., 2008 (if the latter result is accepted despite potential method limitations). However, it should be noted that the base level of ACE2 and also the relative ACE2/ACE ratio in the case of chronic hypertensive patients, many of whom have been on AT1R inhibitor treatment (Koka 2008), and in healthy mice treated with AngII for relatively short time (Patel 2014), may be different leading to response to the stressor (hypertension and AngII) over time. Consistent with this, distinct ACE/ACE2 activity ratios have been demonstrated  in different organs of normal, non-obese diabetic (NOD) and insulin treated NOD  mice, which varied additionally over the time course after the onset of diabetes (Roca-Ho et al., 2014). 

Finally, species specific regulatory differences may be involved that would warrant further examination. But, overall, the studies discussed above illustrate the complex regulatory mechanisms of ACE2 mRNA, protein and activity levels in different tissues and under different stress conditions for the RAS system. 

Rapid and transient up-regulation of ACE2 mRNA followed by down-regulation of ACE2 protein levels has been reported in the lung as a result of LPS induced acute inflammation in mice (Sodhi 2018). In this case the increase of ACE2 mRNA appears to be a rapid and transient compensatory effect to ACE2 protein/activity down-regulation mediated by NFk- B signalling in response to acute inflammation. Inhibiting NF- B signaling by Bay11-7082 restored ACE2 activity, again demonstrating post transcriptional or translational regulation of ACE2 in the lungs. In addition, this study examined the effect of ACE2 dysregulation on the KKS and demonstrated that attenuation of ACE2 activity under conditions of LPS induced inflammation leads to impaired DABK inactivation and enhanced BKB1R signalling (Sodhi 2018).

The underlying mechanisms of post-transcriptional mRNA regulation remain to be elucidated further. There is evidence that small non-coding micro RNAs (miRNA or miRs) may be involved  (Widiasta 2020; Lu 2020; Fang 2017, Lambert 2014 ).

At post-translational level &ndash; enzymatic activity including shedding

Complexity of analysing the regulation of ACE2 function is emphasized even further when enzymatic activity is considered, including its spatial distribution between cell/tissue versus interstitium/plasma, mediated by shedding.

The exact role of ACE2 shedding is not well understood, but proteolytic ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins is a fundamental post-translational regulatory mechanism of the activity/function of a wide variety of proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, receptors and cell adhesion proteins (Lichtenthaler et al., 2018). 

sACE2 activity is increased in patients with heart failure (HF) and correlates with disease severity (Epelman 2008).

In mice in vivo, shedding of ACE2 by TACE was induced by sub-chronic (2 weeks) exogenous AngII treatment (mimicking HF), leading to decreased ACE2 protein level and increased ACE2 mRNA in myocardial tissue with concurrent elevated sACE2 activity (Patel et al., 2014)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1857","Platelet-neutrophil interactions, Increased","KE 1857","Neutrophils represent 50&ndash;70% of all circulating leukocytes in humans and are the foot soldiers of the immune response, being the first immune cell on the scene of an infection or inflammation. They exert their functional roles via a combination of processes, including the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, phagocytosis, and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).  On the other hand, approximately 750 billion platelets circulate in humans and these cells are traditionally known for their role in haemostasis and thrombosis and are first responders at sites of vascular damage. More recently investigations have shown that platelets play important roles in inflammatory and immune processes (Gu et al., 2019), including resolution (Senchenkova et al., 2019). Platelets have a range of different receptors including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors, and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain&ndash;like receptors, which are known to recognise infection (Semple et al., 2011) and are effectors of injury in a variety of pulmonary disorders and syndromes, and facilitate tissue repair (Xu et al., 2016).

These two cell types modulate each other&rsquo;s functions, and neutrophil-platelet interaction and platelet-platelet interactions are increased during inflammation (Lisman, 2018). Circulating platelet&ndash;neutrophil complexes have been observed in many different inflammatory conditions including bacterial infections (Gawaz et al. 1995) and pulmonary syndromes involving inflammation (Caudrillier et al. 2012). The physical interaction between neutrophils and platelets is mediated by multiple molecular mechanisms including platelet P-selectin binding to neutrophil P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (Moore et al. 1995) and platelet glycoprotein Ib&alpha; binding to neutrophil MAC-1 (Simon et al. 2000).

A first important example of functional interaction between the two cell types is the ability of platelets to facilitate neutrophil adhesion to activated endothelial cells (i.e. at the site of inflammation or injury) and to promote their transmigration across the endothelium. Many studies have demonstrated that neutrophils patrol the vasculature for activated platelets to initiate inflammatory responses (Sreeramkumar et al. 2014), hence activated platelets are crucial in neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses (Senchenkova et al., 2019). The depletion of platelets decreases neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation, and the depletion of neutrophils decreases platelet recruitment (Sreeramkumar et al. 2014). During activation, both neutrophils and platelets are capable of releasing microparticles, (MPs, also termed ectosomes) which carry markers of the parent cells outer membrane e.g. neutrophil MPs carry different cell adhesion molecules and proteases such as proteinase 3 or elastase (Ramirez et al., 2019).

Beyond recruitment and localization processes, activated platelets are able to modulate (i.e. both enhancing and inhibiting) neutrophil responses, including phagocytosis, production of ROS, and production of NETs. These effects can be mediated by direct cell-cell contact or by the release of soluble mediators such as CCL5 and platelet factor 4 (von Hundelshausen et al. 2005). On the other hand, neutrophils can also release soluble mediators (e.g. cathepsin G, elastase) that enhance or inhibit platelet responses (Mihara et al. 2013; Bonnefoy and Legrand 2000).

Platelets can stimulate the synthesis of various leukotrienes by neutrophils via transcellular transfer of the arachidonic acid metabolite 12-HETE, which is further processed by neutrophils into bioactive leukotrienes (Rossaint et al., 2018). Platelets also store preformed and immunomodulatory molecules that can affect neutrophils (e.g. affecting chemotaxis) and the immune response, including interleukin-1 and platelet-derived growth factor (Semple et al., 2011).

Over the past several years, the interactions between immune cells such as neutrophils and platelets have been given different names, including: thromboinflammatoin, immunothrombosis and immunohemostasis (Guo et al., 2019). These names have been introduced to try to capture the responses and mechanisms of both cell types (independently and collectively) in thrombosis and inflammation."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/186","Altered, Neuroanatomy","KE 186","TH signalling controls a number of major anatomical processes in development that if altered will lead to permanently abnormal brain morphology. These processes include differentiation of neurons and glia from progenitor cells, neuronal migration, and myelination of axonal processes.  The evidence supporting a role of TH in these neurodevelopmental processes is strong.  Evidence from human is primarily from studies of iodine-deficient children and children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH)(Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). Animal models using rats and mice, as well as in vitro studies, have provided ample evidence of TH control of these processes (Gilbert and Zoeller, 2010).  Below are brief descriptions of the impact of TH insufficiency on two of these processes.
Altered Neuronal Migration: Effects of TH insufficiency on specific developmental events are reflected in alterations in brain structure. Altered lamination and cellular morphology in cerebellum (Koibuchi and Chin, 2000; Morte et al., 2004; Farwell and Dubord-Tomasetti, 1999), hippocampus (Madeira et al., 1991), and the neocortex (Auso et al., 2003; Cuevas et al., 2005) have been documented. In addition presence of aberrantly placed neuronal cells in the corpus callosum have been described (Gilbert et al., 2014, Powell et al., 2012; Shibutani et al., 2009).
Altered Axonal Myelination: Nerve conduction is accelerated by the insulation formed by oligodendrocytes of the myelin sheath that surround axons of many nerve fibers. Reduced size and altered composition of the white matter tracts throughout the brain, the most prominent of which is the corpus callosusm, are hallmarks of severe developmental hypothyroidism (Berbel et al., 1993, 1994; Ferreira et al., 2004; Gravel and Hawkes, 1990; Ibarrola and Rodriguez-Pena, 1997; Schnoover et al., 2005). In addition, more subtle abnormalities have been described in white matter tracks including corpus callosum and anterior commissure following more modest reductions in circulating levels of TH in the neonatal period (Sharlin et al., 2008)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1866","Fibrinolysis, decreased","KE 1866","Background

Fibrinolysis is an essential and highly regulated physiological process resulting in the enzymatic breakdown of intravascular fibrin in blood clots. The process prevents extensive fibrin deposition and  facilitates the degradation of thrombi and microthrombi in any affected organ. Fibrinolysis occurs both within the thrombi, where fibrin strands provide a surface for binding plasminogen (precursor of the primary fibrinolysin, plasmin), as well as on interaction with endothelial cell surfaces.  There are many known disorders of fibrinolysis, including congenital and acquired conditions which can result in inadequate or excessively active fibrinolytic pathways. Acquired disorders resulting in hypofibrinolysis include numerous acute and chronic conditions; malignancy, hypothyroidism, autoimmune disorders and alcoholic liver disease (10.1016/j.blre.2014.09.003). Hypoxia has also been demonstrated to promote hypofribrinolysis (10.1172/JCI307). Conversely, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is one of the better characterized hyperfibrinolytic disorders, associated with systemic inflammation (10.1016/j.blre.2014.09.003). Fibrinolytic pathways act in conjunction with processes regulating coagulation and platelet activity to regulate hemostasis.  An imbalance between coagulation and the fibrinolytic pathways leads to coagulopathy and may, if unresolved, lead to bleeding diatheses, thrombosis and inflammation (thromboinflammation).

 

How the KE works

In normal conditions fibrinolysis begins when tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, gene PLAT), bound to fibrin, and urokinase (uPA, gene PLAU), expressed on the endothelium, converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin breaks down fibrin (which is formed during coagulation), and resolves the fibrin clot. This process results in an increase in the formation of circulating fibrin degradation products (FDP), some of which have been associated with immune activation (Chapin &amp; Hajjar). In addition, D-Dimers, biomarkers for thrombosis, are generated when fibrin polymers get broken down. Fibrin clot formation, activation of coagulation factor XII (FXIIa, also known as the Hageman factor, gene F12) and increased levels of plasminogen, as well as the activation of the bradykinin system by FXIIa-stimulated increased levels of tPA/uPA. A number of endogenous molecules act to prevent excessive clot breakdown; tPA/uPA is inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1, encoded by SERPINE1) and C1-inhibitor (C1-INH, encoded by SERPING1) inhibits plasmin (reviewed in 10.1007/s12016-016-8540-0). Other molecules involved in plasmin inhibition include Alpha 2 antiplasmin (encoded by SERPINF2) and alpha 2 macroglobulin (encoded by A2M), each of which contribute uniquely to the precise regulation of thrombus formation and lysis. A balance must be maintained between clot formation and clot breakdown by regulating tPA and uPA.

 

Fibrinolysis in various diseases, including COVID-19

Fibrinolysis is reported to be dysregulated in several pathologies, including cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, bone destructive disease, lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, psoriasis, endometriosis and COVID-19 (reviewed in 10.1016/j.drudis.2020.06.013). In particular, a hypofibrinolysis state has been reported in e.g. COVID-19 patients who have developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is coupled to high levels of PAI-1 (10.1016/j.drudis.2020.06.013). In addition, reduced levels of transcripts encoding for uPA and the uPA receptor (uPAR) have been reported in the lung tissue of patients with severe COVID-19 (10.7554/eLife.64330).

In COVID-19, the increased levels of PAI-1 have been associated with down-regulated ACE2 activity, which leads to increased angiotensin II (Ang II), which in turn promotes activation of PAI-1 (reviewed in 10.3390/v13010029).

 In contrast, hyperfibrinolysis has also been reported in COVID-19 patients, based on high plasmaD-dimer (DDI) levels (10.3389/fphys.2020.596057). Thus, in some cases SARS-COV-2 promotes activation of the coagulation cascade via tissue factor, leading to high levels of fibrin and hyperactivated fibrinolysis with increased levels of plasmin. Plasmin breaks down fibrin and causes high plasma DDI levels which maintain the hyperfibrinolytic state. In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), plasminogen-plasmin activity has been found to be increased, and the fibrinolytic system is assumed to play a role due to partial inhibition of the tPA/uPA system."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1867","Bradykinin system, hyperactivated","KE 1867","Background

Bradykinin (BK) plays an important role in the kinin-kallikrein system (KKS) as a regulator of blood pressure and can induce vasodilation, increase blood flow, as well as hypotension. BK is also an important part of the inflammatory process after injury, inducing pain stimulation, and increased vascular permeability. Hyperactivation of the BK system is associated with vasodilation and vascular leakage allowing for infiltration of inflammatory cells.

 

How the KE works

BK is formed by the proteolytic activity of kallikrein on kininogens. Kininogens are expressed by alveolar cells (alveolar type 1.1, 1/2, 2.2., 2.3, and 2.4 cells). Plasma kallikrein (produced by the pancreas) processes high-molecular weight kininogen (HMWK produced by the liver) into BK, and tissue kallikrein processes low-molecular weight kininogen (LMWK produced by the liver) into Lys-BK. BK and Lys-BK are ligands for the bradykinin receptor B2R on endothelial cells, e.g. in the alveolar capillaries. Carboxypeptidases further process BK and Lys-BK into des-Arg9-BK and Lys-des-Arg9-BK respectively, which are ligands for B1R on endothelial cells, and which are up-regulated under proinflammatory conditions.

Another factor of the BK-system is the SERPING1 gene which encodes for the  C1-inhibitor. BK can only be produced when the C1-inhibitor is not in effect, allowing the plasma kallikrein to process HMWK into BK. 

ACE and ACE2, e.g. present on type II pneumocytes in the alveoli, also play direct roles in the inactivation of the bradykinin system. ACE catalyzes conversion of BK into inactive peptides, while ACE2 inactivates des-Arg9-BK (DABK) and Lys-des-Arg9-BK. Thus, down-regulation of the enzymes leads to activation of the bradykinin system. Furthermore, BK receptor signaling (B1R and B2R) is augmented by the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), and increased levels of angiotensin II (AngII) and angiotensin 1-9 (Ang1-9) may indicate activation of the BK system (potentially through resensitization of B2R).

Finally, the coagulation factor XII (F12) is a direct activator of kallikrein, through cleavage of prekallikrein into plasma kallikrein.

 

Evidence for the KEs perturbation

In COVID-19

In response to SARS-COV-2 infection, BK production increases due to the SERPING1 gene that encodes for the C1-inhibitor being strongly downregulated as a result of infection (10.7554/eLife.59177). Downregulation of ACE2 and upregulation of ACE causes RAS to produce the BK-augmenting peptide Ang1-9 (10.3390/v13010029). The shift of the system towards increased production of BK, increased DABK, and increased B1R/B2R signaling leads to a hyperactive BK system or &ldquo;storm,&rdquo; potentially responsible for many COVID-19 symptoms. The BK storm is maintained by several points of inhibition, including suppressed NFkappaB, Vitamin D and its receptor, and the previously mentioned decreased expression of SERPING1. BK overproduction causes blood vessels to burst, leading to the leakage of fluid into the lungs, and hyaluronic acid overproduction causing the lungs to be unable to take in oxygen and expel CO2. This ultimately leads to the severe breathing symptoms of COVID-19 (10.7554/eLife.57555). The BK storm is also known to affect other major organs like the kidneys, cardiac tissue, muscles, and the brain.

In addition, the ACE2 receptor is known to be co-expressed with elements of the kallikrein-kinin (bradykinin) system (10.1038/s41598-020-76488-2)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1868","Hyperinflammation","KE 1868","Hyperinflammation can be defined as an uncontrolled and self-perpetuating inflammatory process that results in tissue damage. The state of hyperinflammation is also observed in cytokine storm syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome and in conditions of sepsis; however, it is not a frequent observation. For example, in COVID-19 infection, hyperinflammation plays a critical role in driving the disease severity. Although high viral titre initiates the cascade, the disease severity itself is dependent on the severity of the inflammatory state.

Clinically, the hallmarks of hyperinflammation state include excessive serum levels of pro-inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP), reduced or absence of lymphocytes (lymphopenia), high levels of ferritin and D-dimer, and increased lactate dehydrogenase. Higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is another clinical marker. Some research studies have also associated high serum levels of IL6 protein and accumulation of neutrophils to be causal and indicative of hyperinflammation. Other molecular markers associated with hyperinflammation include IL1ꞵ and TNFɑ and have together with IL6 and a multitude of other cytokines, chemokines and other proinflammatory factors been identified as potential therapeutic targets (Desvaux et al. 2021). While the total serum levels of these markers is important, more critically, how fast the levels increase in serum is taken into consideration in judging the severity (Bergamaschi et al. 2021). The number of studies that have reported on the various markers of hyperinflammation is listed in Table-1.

 

Although the initiation and promotion of inflammation involves several cell types including epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, type I and II pneumocytes and dendritic cells, the cell types that play role on inducing hyperinflammatory state may include macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. Lack of neutrophil plays an important role in slowing the viral clearance and thus perpetuating the condition. Hyperferritinaemia is associated with high macrophage activation.

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1869","Diminished protective oxidative stress response","KE 1869","The &quot;Diminished Protective Oxidative Stress Response&quot; is a critical key event in the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework that plays a central role in understanding how exposure to various stressors can lead to adverse outcomes.

Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and the detoxification of reactive intermediates. Reactive intermediates such as peroxides and free radicals can be very damaging to many parts of cells such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. Severe oxidative stress can trigger apoptosis and necrosis. (Ref. IPA, NRF2-mediated Oxidative Stress Response, version60467501, release date: 2020-11-19)

One essential component of this key event is the activity of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the oxidative stress response. Detecting Nrf2 activity is crucial for assessing the status of the oxidative stress response.

The cellular defence/defense response to oxidative stress includes induction of detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant enzymes. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) binds to the antioxidant response elements (ARE) within the promoter of these enzymes and activates their transcription. Inactive Nrf2 is retained in the cytoplasm by association with an actin-binding protein Keap1. Upon exposure of cells to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is phosphorylated in response to the protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways. After phosphorylation, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, binds AREs, and transactivates detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P450, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase, heme oxygenase, and superoxide dismutase. (Ref. IPA, NRF2-mediated Oxidative Stress Response, version60467501, release date: 2020-11-19)

Nrf2, a master regulator of oxidative stress through enhanced expression of anti-oxidant genes of glutathione and thioredoxin-antioxidant systems, has anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an activator of Nrf2, can decrease inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the inhibition of NF-kappaB by inducing anti-oxidant enzymes (Jackson et al, 2014; Hassan et al, 2020; Timpani et al, 2021).

Inactivation of Nrf2 causes diminished protective responses to ROS."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1875","Cerebrovascular disease (stroke)","KE 1875","A stroke or cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is the result of an acute disruption of the cerebral perfusion or vasculature (Khaku and Tadi, 2020). The majority of strokes are of ischemic origin and only a small percent of hemorrhagic origin. Ischemic stroke can be further characterised into embolic, thrombotic, and lacunar. 

Lacunar strokes result from disruption of the small penetrating branches of the middle cerebral artery, vertebral or basilar artery or the lenticulostriate vessels. Most common causes of lacunar strokes include microemboli and fibrinoid necrosis secondary to vasculitis. 

Hemorrhagic etiologies can be from aneurysm rupture, arteriovenous malformations, venous angiomas, bleeding due to drugs.

In general, the common risk factors for stroke include hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and drug use. 

Patients with CVD can show any of the following symptoms 


	Disturbance of consciousness (e.g. not alert and responsive, arouses to noxious stimuli, comatose&hellip;)
	Language difficulties in fluency, naming, comprehension and repetition 
	Dysarthria (slurring) 
	Motor deficits (e.g. subtle arm weakness)
	Visual field deficits
	Eye movement abnormalities 
	Facial paralysis 
	Ataxia 
	Nausea, 
	Vomiting 
	Vertigo


Based on the symptoms, the localisation of the stroke in brain areas can be diagnosed and also support the categorisation to the following stroke syndromes: a) Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) Infarction, b) Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Infarction, c) Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) Infarction and c) Cerebellar Infarction."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1877","Altered, retinal layer structure","KE 1877","The anatomy and histology of the eye are highly conserved among vertebrates. The cornea and lens refract and focus light onto the posterior chamber of the eye, the vitreous cavity, which is covered by the retina. The retina consists of three specialised layers of cells, the outermost of which is formed by photoreceptors that absorb light and transmit the subsequent neural signal to the innermost layers, which consist of neurons specialised in processing and transmitting this neural signal (W&auml;ssle and Riemann, 1978; Cameron and Carney, 2000 ; Rockhill et al, 2000; Fadool, 2003). The neurons of the innermost layer converge to form the optic nerve, which transmits visual information to the brain (Gestri et al., 2012). The retina has different types of photoreceptors, the cones, which are responsible for colour vision, and the rods, which enable vision in the dark or in very low light conditions. In adults, cones are distributed in the retina in a precise and very regular arrangement, forming a photoreceptor mosaic. The precise spatiotemporal pattern of maturation of cones may affect the organization of this mosaic, and THs appear to play a role in the coordination of this maturation process (Suzuki et al., 2013). In the fish retina, this arrangement is most evident in the outer nuclear layer where the position of each cone subtype is precisely arranged relative to the others (Fadool, 2003; Robinson et al., 1993) resulting in a highly ordered crystalline-like mosaic. 

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is important to maintain a healthy and functional retina (Strauss 2005). The strong connection between the RPE cells with the tight junction, creates a blood-retinal barrier to mediate the directional transport of ions, water and nutrients while removing waste products. Another key function of the RPE is to absorb excess light energy to protect the neural retina from phototoxicity (Plafker 2012). Phagocytosis of spilled photoreceptor outer segments (Lister 2002) is another function of the RPE to maintain balanced photoreceptor growth, which is important for their physiological function.

Studies that detect and measure altered retinal layer structure after exposure to THs or endocrine disruptors show, for example, altered cone cell number (Allison et al., 2006; Houbrechts et al., 2016; Vancamp et al., 2019), altered retinal cell number (Dong et al., 2014), or a general alteration of retinal morphology (Gamborino et al., 2001; Houbrechts et al., 2016; Komoike et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Reider &amp; Connaughton, 2014), alteration of the RPE      (Baumann et al., 2016), abnormal cone differentiation (Duval &amp; Allison, 2018; Suzuki et al., 2013; Viets et al., 2016) or prevention of the opsin switch (Gan &amp; Flamarique, 2010; Raine &amp; Hawryshyn, 2009). Especially the TH receptor TR&beta; seems to be a key regulator by determining the expression of photoreceptor development in the retina (Ng et al., 2010; Suzuki et al., 2013; Deveau et al., 2019, 2020)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1879","Bulky DNA adducts, increase","KE 1879","Bulky DNA adducts are formed when activated genotoxic aromatic compounds interact with the nitrogenous bases of DNA. This occurs at various sites. The most common reactive sites for these adduct is C8, N7, N3 and N2 positions of guanine, the N7, N6, N3, and N1 positions of adenine, the N3, N4, and O2 positions of cytosine, and the N3, O2, and O4 positions of thymine (As reviewed by Hwa Yun et al., 2020). The position of the adduct depends on the chemical structure of the activated aromatic compound. Some adducts are not stable, but some can persist. For example, the most harmful adducts formed by benzo(a)pyrene are from radicals that bind to the N7 and C8 of purines (IARC., 2012). Aristolochic Acid forms adducts at N6 of adenine and Aflatoxin B1 forms adducts at the N7 of Guanine (Arlt et al., 2002). This KE describes an increase in Bulky adducts. These adducts can cause depurination, transversions which in turn cause DNA damage and chromosome aberrations."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/188","Neuroinflammation","KE 188","Neuroinflammation or brain inflammation differs from peripheral inflammation in that the vascular response and the role of peripheral bone marrow-derived cells are less conspicuous. The most easily detectable feature of neuroinflammation is activation of microglial cells and astrocytes. It is evidenced by changes in shape, increased expression of certain antigens, and accumulation and proliferation of the glial cells in affected regions (Aschner, 1998; Graeber &amp; Streit, 1990; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Streit et al, 1999; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Claycomb et al., 2013). Upon stimulation by cytokines or inflammogens (e.g. from pathogens or from damaged neurons), both glial cell types activate inflammatory signalling pathways, which result in increased expression and/or release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, eicosanoids, and metalloproteinases (Dong &amp; Benveniste, 2001), as well as in the production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) (Brown &amp; Bal-Price, 2003). Different types of activation states are possible for microglia and astrocytes, resulting in pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory signalling and other cellular functions (such as phagocytosis) (Streit et al., 1999; Nakajima and Kohsaka, 2004).

Therefore, neuroinflammation can have both neuroprotective/neuroreparative and neurodegenerative consequences (Carson et al., 2006 ; Monnet-Tschudi et al, 2007; Aguzzi et al., 2013 ; Glass et al., 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, microglial cells scan the nervous system for neuronal integrity (Nimmerjahn et al, 2005) and for invading pathogens (Aloisi, 2001; Kreutzberg, 1995; Kreutzberg, 1996; Rivest, 2009). They are the first type of cell activated (first line of defence), and can subsequently induce astrocyte activation (Falsig, 2008). Two distinct states of microglial activation have been described (Gordon, 2003; Kigerl et al, 2009; Maresz et al, 2008; Mosser &amp; Edwards, 2008; Perego et al; Ponomarev et al, 2005; Moehle and West, 2015): The M1 state is classically triggered by interferon-gamma and/or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and this state is characterized by increased expression of integrin alpha M (Itgam) and CD86, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6), and it is mostly associated with neurodegeneration. The M2 state is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 (Maresz et al, 2008; Perego et al, 2011; Ponomarev et al, 2007) and induces the expression of mannose receptor 1 (MRC1), arginase1 (Arg 1) and Ym1/2; it is involved in repair processes. The activation of astrocytes by microglia-derived cytokines or TLR agonists resembles the microglial M1 state (Falsig 2006). Although classification of the M1/M2 polarization of microglial cells may be considered as a simplification of authentic microglial reaction states (Ransohoff, 2016), a similar polarization of reactive astrocytes has been descibed recently Liddlelow et al., 2017): Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha), TNF and subcomponent q (C1q) released by activated microglial cells induce A1-reactive astrocytes, which lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes.

 

Neuroinflammation and Brain development

During brain development, microglia are known to play a critical role as shapers of neural circuits, by providing trophic factors and by remodeling and pruning synapses (Rajendran and Paolicelli, 2018). In addition to playing a role in synaptic management, microglia are important for the pruning of dying neurons and in the clearance of debris (Harry, 2013). Microglia seem to affect also processes associated with neuronal proliferation and differentiation (Harry and Kraft, 2012). Similarly to microglia, astrocytes have instructive roles in neurogenesis, gliogenesis, angiogenesis, axonal outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic pruning (Reemst et al., 2016).

The development-dependent reactivity of microglial cells and astrocytes is not well known. Ischemic insult appears to elicit similar microglial reactivity both during brain development and in adulthood (Baburamani et al, 2014; Leonardo &amp; Pennypacker, 2009). In contrast, treatment with lead acetate was previously shown to result in a more pronounced microglial and astrocyte reactivity in immature 3D rat brain cell cultures as compared to mature ones (Zurich et al, 2002). Astrocyte reactivity was also more pronounced in immature 3D rat brain cell cultures following paraquat exposure, whereas development-dependent differences in the phenotype of reactive microglia were observed (Sandstr&ouml;m et al., 2017). This suggests that neuroinflammation is occurring during brain development and may express a different phenotype than in adulthood, and that dysfunction of microglia and astrocyte during brain development could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and potentially to late-onset neuropathology (Reemst et al., 2016).

 

Neuroinflammation in relation to COVID19

SARS-CoV-2 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 presented an elevated plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is known as biochemical indicator of glial activation (Kanberg et al., 2020)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1880","Inhibition of ALDH1A (RALDH)","KE 1880","The oxidation of retinal to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is an irreversible reaction carried out by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3 (RALDH1, RALDH2, RALDH3). ALDH1A2 is responsible for the second step of the metabolism of vitamin A into atRA (Chatzi et al, 2013; Shannon et al, 2017).The role of that reaction is to maintain atRA concentrations, with ALDH1A2 being most active during early development (Koppaka et al, 2012; Shannon et al, 2017). Raldh2-deficient mice exhibit severe developmental defects due to loss of atRA, but the phenotype is rescued by administration of exogenous RA (Niederreither et al, 1999). Thus, ALDH1A2 activity is essential for atRA-dependent developmental processes."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1881","Decreased, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) concentration","KE 1881","All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is the active form of vitamin A/all-trans retinol and is involved in regulating a large number of developmental processes (Bushue &amp; Wan, 2010a; Ghyselinck &amp; Duester, 2019). Although 9-cis RA and 13-cis RA are other metabolic derivatives of vitamin A, atRA is generally considered the primary active metabolite during development, mainly acting as a short-range paracrine signaling molecule (Cunningham &amp; Duester, 2015). atRA exerts dose-dependent effects on morphogenesis, so disruption to atRA concentrations during development can lead to malformations in numerous tissues and organs. During development the spatiotemporal regulation of atRA concentrations in target tissues is tightly controlled by a balance of synthesis and degradation enzymes (Kedishvili, 2013). 

Cellular atRA synthesis starts by oxidation of vitamin A to retinaldehyde (RAL) by retinol dehydrogenase-10 (RDH10). RAL is then irreversibly converted to atRA by RAL dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1, ALD1A2, or ALDH1A3). To maintain appropriate retinoid levels in tissues, RAL can be converted back to retinol by enzymatic reactions; further retinoid levels can be controlled by enzymatic degradation of atRA by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP26A1, CYP26B1, or CYP26C1, which are differentially expressed throughout the mammalian body (Isoherranen &amp; Zhong, 2019; Shimozono et al, 2013). Inhibition/disruption of any of the enzymes of the atRA synthesis pathway, or increased expression of the atRA degradation enzymes can lead to decreased concentrations of atRA in target cells (Kedishvili, 2013).

The atRA functions as a ligand for the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs); the atRA:RAR:RXR complex then binds to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) upstream of target genes, leading to activation or repression of gene expression in target cells (Chambon, 1996; le Maire et al, 2019). The type and number of RAR/RXRs differ between evolutionary distant animals, but functionally they are all involved in the regulation of development (Gutierrez-Mazariegos et al, 2014)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1882","Disrupted meiotic initiation of fetal oogonia of the ovary","KE 1882","Oocyte meiosis

Oogonia, the female germ cells, are the precursors for the female oocytes. Primary oocytes are formed in the ovaries during fetal development when oogonia enter into prophase I of meiosis; meiotic entry initiates at around embryonic (E) day 13.5 in mice, E15.5 in rats, and gestational week 10-12 in humans. The entry into meiosis is driven by expression of the key genes Stra8, Meiosin and Rec8 and is followed by expression of meiotic proteins including SYCP3 and &gamma;H2AX (Baltus et al, 2006; Bowles et al, 2006; Ishiguro et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2019; Koubova et al, 2014; Spiller et al, 2017). The crucial role for Stra8 in meiotic entry is conserved from mice to humans (Childs et al, 2011).

Disrupted meiotic entry as Key Event

The initiation of meiosis during fetal life is critical for maintenance of the oocytes throughout development and, eventually, for establishing the oocyte pool, or &lsquo;oocyte reserve&rsquo; at birth. Without timely fetal entry into meiosis, the oogonia are depleted, as evidenced in Stra8-null mice (Baltus et al, 2006). The Stra8-null female mice are infertile and display abnormally small ovaries that are devoid of oocytes. For Stra8 to be expressed and, therefore, for meiosis to initiate, the oogonia require direct stimulation by atRA as evidenced in mice (Bowles et al, 2016; Bowles et al, 2006; Feng et al, 2021; Koubova et al, 2006; Spiller et al, 2017; Teletin et al, 2017), and humans (Childs et al, 2011; Le Bouffant et al, 2010)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1884","Inhibition of Fyna","KE 1884","Src family kinases (SFKs) include nine members (i.e., Src, Fyn, Yes, Blk, Yrk, Fgr, Hck, Lck and Lyn) and regulate multiple signal transduction pathways involved in growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism and apoptosis, interacting with a diverse array of molecules, including growth factor receptors, cell&ndash;cell adhesion receptors, integrins and steroid hormone receptors (Schenone et al., 2007). Protein kinases enable transfer of &gamma; phosphate of ATP to specific amino acids of protein substrates (tyrosine, serine, threonine, or even histidine residues) (Saito, 2001). There are two major groups of tyrosine kinases: receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (cytoplasmatic proteins) are important components of signaling pathways through different receptors such as receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, or T-cell receptors (TCR) on the cell surface (Hanrs &amp; Hunter, 1995). 

Fyna (Src family tyrosine kinase A) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase.  It is involved in several processes, including adherens junction maintenance and gastrulation. Fyna localizes to the cytosol and the nucleus. It is expressed in the central nervous system, olfactory placode, peripheral olfactory organ, and retina. Human ortholog(s) of this gene are implicated in Alzheimer&#39;s disease and schizophrenia. Zebrafish Fyna gene is orthologous to human FYN (FYN proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase) (ZFIN Gene: Fyna, n.d.) and shares 89% sequence identity (full length sequence and kinase domain) with the human FYN gene (Challa &amp; Chatti, 2013). 

The Src family kinases are of a modular nature, consisting of a unique N-terminal sequence, three protein modules including the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains, and a C-terminal tail. The modules play an important role in enzyme reactions (Lamers et al., 2003). Fyna kinase activity, like that of other Src family kinases, is regulated by intramolecular interactions that depend on equilibrium between tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. In the basal state, catalytic activity is constrained by engagement of the SH2 domain by a phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine 531 (Kr&auml;mer-Albers &amp; White, 2011), after activation enzymes transmit signals from several surface receptors to target proteins by phosphorylating tyrosine residues (Sen and Johnson, 2011). Crystal structures of the SH2 and SH3 domains of the Fyna kinase reveal its binding specificity for peptide inhibitors (Morton et al., 1996; Mulhern et al., 1997). Binding of inhibitors to fyna domains inhibits its activity. Research in inhibition of Fyna kinase is mostly due its role in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and anti-inflamatory therapy (L&ouml;wenberg et al., 2005).

There are multiple known Fyna kinase inhibitors (see Evidence for perturbation by stressor)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1885","Inhibition of Plxna2","KE 1885","Plexins (Plxns) are the receptors encoded by the members of the plexin gene family. They are primary transducers of vertebrate semaphorin (Sema) signals. The vertebrate plexins are subdivided into four subfamilies comprising four type A plexins, three type B plexins, plexin C1 (PlEXC1) and plexin D1(Neufeld &amp; Kessler, 2008; Tamagnone et al., 1999). The plexins are transmembrane receptors distinguished by the presence of a split gTPase-activating (gAP) cytoplasmic domain (Oinuma et al., 2004). Semaphorins are members of a large gene family of secreted and membrane-anchored proteins. There are eight subclasses of Semas. Semas 1 and 2 are found in invertebrates, 3&ndash;7 are found in vertebrates, and Sema V is found in the genome of non-neurotropic DNA viruses. They were initially characterized as axon guidance factors and are divided into eight subfamilies. The  receptors belonging to the plexin family function as semaphorin receptors (Neufeld &amp; Kessler, 2008). Semas were initially discovered with respect to their role as repulsive guidance cues for migrating axons, although it is now appreciated that they have much broader roles in development. Semas and Plxns have tissue-specific expression patterns, and many Semas can signal through multiple Plxn family members (Luo et al., 1993). 

Plxna2 is predicted to have semaphorin receptor activity. Involved in optic vesicle formation, predicted to localize to integral component of plasma membrane and semaphorin receptor complex. Is expressed in several structures, including brain; hatching gland; olfactory field; optic vesicle; and retina and is critical to zebrafish eye development. Orthologous to human PLXNA2 (plexin A2)(ZFIN Gene: Plxna2, n.d.).

Sema-Plxn signaling regulates cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, proliferation, and differentiation. However, the receptor-proximal signaling mechanisms driving Sema-Plxn signal transduction are only partially understood. Plxn tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to play an important role in these signaling events as receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have been shown to interact with Plxn receptors (St. Clair et al., 2018). Phosphorylation is one of the fundamental mechanisms of cell signaling and regulation of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, neural function, etc. (Hanrs &amp; Hunter, 1995; Johnson &amp; Lewis, 2010; Mellado et al., 2001). Tyrosine phosphorylation is a pivotal post-translational protein modification that regulates intracellular signalling. Therefore, phosphorylation of tyrosines in the intracellular domain of plex-ins could determine or modify their interactions with additional signal transducers (Franco &amp; Luca Tamagnone, 2008)."

Predicted to have GTP binding activity and GTPase activity. Involved in mesendoderm development. Predicted to localize to membrane. Is expressed in several structures, including axis; central nervous system; presumptive ectoderm; shield; and tail bud. Orthologous to human RASL11B (RAS like family 11 member B) (ZFIN Gene: Rasl11b, n.d.). The Rasl11b protein is highly conserved among vertebrates, sharing on average 94% homology with its mammalian orthologs (P&eacute;zeron et al., 2008)

Rasl11b is highly conserved in vertebrates and is atypical to most Ras-like family members in two ways. First, it is cytosolic and lacks carboxy terminal lipid modification sites which allow for membrane anchoring (Pezeron et al., 2008). Second, it has a lower GTPase activity than Ras, and is more often in its active GTP-bound state (Colicelli, 2004). Ras proteins are well known to be involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, therefore, it is hypothesized that Rasl11b acts as a negative regulator of MAPK by outcompeting Ras for its effectors such as Raf, leading to decreases in RPC proliferation seen in morphant zebrafish embryos (Emerson et al., 2017)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1888","Increased (ectopic) all-trans retinoic acid concentration","KE 1888","Retinoic acid (RA) function and metabolism 

RA and retinoid signaling is central for numerous physiological processes, and has important roles within reproduction, vision, development and the immune system (O&#39;Byrne &amp; Blaner, 2013). As an important morphogen, the levels of RA is tightly controlled within tissues both spatially and temporally. Both insufficient and excess RA has proven to cause severe adverse effects (Kedishvili, 2013).

RA homeostasis is maintained by tissue-specific enzymes controlling a 2-step biosynthesis pathway: the precursor retinol is converted into retinaldehyde via retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs). Retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) then irreversibly oxidize retinaldehyde into biologically active RA (reviewed by (Shannon et al, 2017)). RA is removed via degradation to polar inactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 (CYP) family hydroxylases; chiefly CYP26A1, B1 and C1 (Topletz et al, 2015).

RA signals through the nuclear Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs) and Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs) thereby regulating transcription of target genes (Cunningham &amp; Duester, 2015).

 

Ectopic RA as Key Event

Inhibition or disruption of any of the enzymes in the RA degradation pathway, including the Cyp26 family, lead to increased concentrations of biologically active RA in target cells.

Equally, application of RA for medical treatments, including for acute promyelocytic leukemia and cystic acne, lead to increased concentrations of biologically active RA in target cells."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1889","Premature initiation of meiosis in fetal male germ cells","KE 1889","Male germ cell fate, fetal life

In male mammals, the XY germ cells initially proliferate during early stages of fetal testis differentiation, then enter a stage of mitotic arrest. Once in this G0/G1 cell cycle phase, the germ cells gradually stop expressing several pluripotency markers and start expressing genes considered characteristic of male germ cell differentiation (Spiller &amp; Bowles, 2019). The mitotically arrested germ cells, now referred to as pro-spermatogonia (McCarrey, 2013), remain quiescent until after birth (McLaren, 1984). 

 

Premature meiosis as Key Event

Germ cells in developing testis enter cell cycle quiescence during fetal life; i.e. they must avoid entering meiosis as germ cells do in the fetal ovary. In the ovaries, germ cell meiosis is initiated by the presence of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) which induces expression of key pre-meiotic gene Stra8 (Bowles et al, 2006; Koubova et al, 2006). In the testes, atRA is degraded by the CYP26B1 enzyme, and therefore germ cells do not express Stra8 and do not enter meiosis (Bowles et al, 2006; Koubova et al, 2006; MacLean et al, 2007; Spiller et al, 2017; Trautmann et al, 2008). It is not yet clear how atRA concentrations are controlled in the human fetal testis. Regardless, there is evidence that the presence of atRA during human fetal testis development is detrimental to germ cell development (J&oslash;rgensen et al, 2015)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1895","NLRP3 inflammasome activity, increased","KE 1895","The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system that mediates Caspase 1 (CASP1) activation. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimolecular complex composed of the sensor molecule NLRP3, the adaptor protein PYCARD (commonly called ASC), and pro-caspase 1 (Yang et al, 2019b). In activated inflammasome pro-caspase 1 is cleaved into active CASP1 which subsequently cleaves and thus activates highly pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1B (IL1B) and IL18 leading to increased inflammation (Kelley et al, 2019). NLRP3 inflammasome activation can also induce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of a cell death (Bergsbaken et al, 2009). Inflammasome activation is associated with COVID-19 disease severity and poor clinical outcome (Rodrigues et al, 2021). NLRP3 inflammasomes can assemble in many cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, B cells and T cells, epithelial cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, astrocytes, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, etc (Enni et al, 2020; Ershaid et al, 2019; Wree et al, 2014; Wu et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2019a; Zheng et al, 2020)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1901","Interferon-I antiviral response, antagonized by SARS-CoV-2","KE 1901","SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of ~30 kb, sequence orientation in a 5&rsquo; to 3&rsquo; direction typical of positive sense and reflective of the resulting mRNA (doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.01). The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a 5&rsquo;-untranslated region (UTR; 265 bp), ORF1ab (21,289 bp) holding two overlapping open reading frames (13,217 bp and 21,289 bp, respectively) that encode two polyproteins (Kim et al. 2020; O&rsquo;Leary et al. 2020). Viral transcription and replication is explained in depth in KE1847. Briefly, the first event upon cell entry is the primary translation of the ORF1a and ORF1b genomic RNA to produce non-structural proteins (NSPs). The ORF1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 440&ndash;500 kDa) that is cleaved into NSP-1 through NSP-11. A -1-ribosome frameshift occurs immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, to allow translation through ORF1b, yielding 740&ndash;810 kDa polypeptide pp1ab, which is cleaved into 15 NSPs (duplications of NSP1-11 and five additional proteins, NSP12-16). Viral proteases NSP3 and NSP5 cleave the polypeptides through domains functioning as a papain-like protease and a 3C-like protease, respectively (doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.01).  The NSPs, structural proteins, and accessory proteins are encoded by 10 ORFs in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. They may have multiple functions during viral replication as well as in evasion of the host innate immune response, thus augmenting viral replication and spread (Amor et al. 2020). Extensive protein-protein interaction (Gordon et al. 2020) and viral protein-host RNA interaction networks have been demonstrated between the viral NSPs and accessory proteins and host molecules. 

This key event is focused on the specific viral:host protein interactions within the infected cell that are involved in the IFN-I antiviral response pathways. IFN-I is the main component of the innate immune system that is suppressed by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus early in infection. The primary form of host intracellular virus surveillance detects viral components to induce an immediate systemic type I interferon (IFN) response. Cellular RNA sensors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 detect the presence of viral RNAs and promote nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF3, leading to transcription, translation, and secretion of IFN-&alpha; and IFN-&beta;. This in turn leads to interaction with the IFN receptor (IFNAR), phosphorylation of STAT1 and 2, and transcription and translation of hundreds of antiviral genes (Quarleri and Delpino, 2021).

Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human RNAs thwart the IFN response upon infection: NSP1 binds to 40S ribosomal RNA in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome to inhibit host mRNA translation; NSP8 and NSP9 displace signal recognition particle proteins (SRP54, 27 and 19) to bind to the 7SL RNA and block protein trafficking to the cell membrane (Banerjee et al. 2020; Gordon et al. 2020). Xia et al. (2020) found that NSP6 and NSP13 antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: NSP6 binds TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, and NSP13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation. NSP14 induces lysosomal degradation of type 1 IFNAR to prevent STAT activation (Hayn et al. 2021). ORF6 hijacks KPNA2 to block IRF3, and Nup98/RAE1 to block STAT nuclear import, to silence IFN-I gene expression (Xia and Shi, 2020). ORF7a suppresses STAT2 phosphorylation and ORF7b suppresses STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation to block ISGF3 complex formation with IRF9 (Xia and Shi, 2020). ORF8 interacts and downregulates MHC-I (Zhang et al 2020), and has been reported to block INF&beta; expression, but the mechanism has not been identified (Rashid et al. 2021; Li et al. 2020). ORF9b antagonizes Type I Interferons by targeting multiple components of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TOMM70, NEMO and cGAS-STING signalling (Han et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2021; Gordon et al 2020).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1906","Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Function, Decreased","KE 1906","The cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is a multi-domain membrane protein that belongs to the large family of adenine nucleotide binding cassette transporters consisting of two transmembrane domains, two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and a unique regulatory domain (Riordan, 2008). It is an integral membrane glycoprotein that functions as cAMP-activated and phosphorylation-regulated Cl&ndash; channel at the apical membrane of epithelial cells (Farinha et al., 2013).
In respiratory epithelia, CFTR is the major Cl&ndash; channel that mediates fluid and electrolyte transport, and CFTR function is critical to normal ASL homeostasis. Exposure to inhaled oxidants, such as ozone and cigarette smoke, leads to decreased CFTR gene and protein expression as well as CFTR internalization, thereby reducing or abolishing short-circuit currents (Qu et al., 2009; Cantin et al., 2006a; Cantin et al., 2006b; Clunes et al., 2012; Sloane et al., 2012; Rasmussen et al., 2014). Reduced CFTR gene transcription rates were mechanistically linked to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, resulting in decreased mRNA and protein expression, presumably in a protein kinase-dependent manner (Bargon et al., 1992a; Bargon et al., 1992b). Cigarette smoke exposure of primary human bronchial epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface was shown to rapidly increase intracellular Ca2+, followed by a decrease in cell surface CFTR expression (Rasmussen et al., 2014). Of note, this decrease by CFTR internalization was subsequently linked to decreased active Cl&ndash; transport and a reduction in ASL height/volume (Clunes et al., 2012). Similarly, treatment with pyocyanin, a redox-active virulence factor secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa which commonly infects the airways of cystic fibrosis patients, increased hydrogen peroxide levels in CFBE41o- bronchial epithelial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, leading to oxidation of the cytosol and inhibited forskolin-stimulated ion transport (Schwarzer et al., 2008). Other possible mechanisms of acquired CFTR dysfunction include direct covalent modification of the protein by cigarette smoke and acrolein (Raju et al., 2013; Raju et al., 2016a) or modulation of channel open probability (Zhang et al., 2013; Woodworth, 2015)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1907","Airway Surface Liquid Height, Decreased","KE 1907","The airway surface liquid (ASL) is a liquid layer on the apical side of the respiratory epithelium, reportedly between 5 to 100 &mu;m in depth (Widdicombe and Widdicombe, 1995), and consists of an inner aqueous periciliary liquid layer (PCL) that spans the length of cilia and the outer gel-like mucus layer. The PCL has a low viscosity and enables cilia beating, thereby facilitating the forward movement of the outer mucus layer toward the glottis and, ultimately, its removal by cough or ingestion (Antunes and Cohen, 2007). Both ASL composition and height  are considered critical for its function (Fischer and Widdicombe, 2006).
Under physiological conditions, ASL composition and height are regulated via vectorial transport of electrolytes, driven by transepithelial transport and apical secretion of Cl&minus; by (predominantly) CFTR, resulting in passive H2O secretion and, consequently, increased ASL height. Absorption of Na+ at the apical side by the epithelial sodium channel ENaC and ENaC&rsquo;s interaction with the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase exchanging Na+ for K+ leads to net absorption of Na+, which in turn drives fluid absorption and therefore decreases ASL height (Althaus, 2013; Hollenhorst et al., 2011). Impairment of CFTR or ENaC function can lead to the dysfunction of the other ion channel (increased CFTR activity leads to decreased ENaC activity and vice versa) (Boucher R., 2003; Boucher, 2004; Schmid et al., 2011), resulting in permanently perturbed ASL height."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1908","Cilia Beat Frequency, Decreased","KE 1908","Cohesive beating of cilia lining the upper and lower respiratory tract is critical for efficient MCC. CBF is influenced by several factors including changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ASL (especially the periciliary fluid), structural modulation in the cilia, concentration of cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, and intracellular calcium (Ca2+). Formation of cyclic nucleotides such as cGMP is mediated by nitric oxide (NO), which is released by an enzyme family of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) when the substrate L-arginine (L-Arg) is transformed to L-citrulline. NO activates its receptor protein, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which catalyzes formation of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP then activates protein kinase G (PKG) which has been implicated in the regulation of CBF (Jiao et al., 2011; Li et al., 2000). NO-dependent stimulation of CBF has also been associated with an increase in cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (Di Benedetto et al., 1991; Lansley et al., 1992; Salathe et al., 1993; Sanderson and Dirksen, 1989; Schmid et al., 2007; Sisson et al., 1999; Uzlaner and Priel, 1999). An increase in intracellular endogenous cAMP was observed after treatment with isobutyl-1-methylxanthine that also increased CBF (Tamaoki et al., 1989). cAMP accumulation in the airway cilia has been shown to be dependent on Ca2+&ndash;calmodulin-dependent PDE1A and indirectly regulates CBF (Kogiso et al., 2018). Increase in CBF after treatment with NO substrate, L-arginine and inhibition of CBF by a NOS inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) further provides evidence for the role of NO in increasing CBF (Jiao J. et al., 2011; Sisson J. H., 1995; Uzlaner and Priel, 1999; Yang et al., 1997). 
Modulation of CBF is not always accompanied by changes in cAMP levels. PKC activators, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and L-o~-dioctanoylglycerol have been shown to decrease CBF in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells (Kobayashi et al., 1989). CBF has been shown to decrease after exposure to inhaled oxidants such as cigarette smoke across different species. A study with 120 subjects showed a significant decrease in nasal CBF following exposure to tobacco smoke (Agius et al., 1998). Exposure to cigarette smoke extract lead to reduction in forskolin-induced CBF in human sinonasal epithelium (Cohen et al., 2009) and  isoproterenol- and methacholine-induced CBF in human adenoid tissues (Wang et al., 2012). This decrease in CBF and unresponsiveness to beta-agonist stimulation occurs in parallel to PKC activation and has been shown to be dependent on the duration of exposure to cigarette smoke in mice (Simet et al., 2010). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to aerosolized nicotine showed decreased CFTR and BK conductance, impaired CBF, ASL volume, and decreased expression of FOXJ1 and KCNMA1 (Garcia-Arcos et al., 2016). 
A concentration-dependent decrease in CBF has been observed after treatment with aldehydes. For example inhibition of cilia ATPase activity was observed after treatment with acetaldehyde, in ciliated bovine bronchial epithelial cells (Sisson et al., 1991). Acrolein, an aldehyde in the gas phase of cigarette smoke, induced ciliostasis at high concentrations (&gt; 1 mM), after 5 min of treatment, and cellular necrosis after 3 hr. However, at lower concentrations (from 0.5‒1 mM), acrolein transiently reduced the CBF to 4 Hz (Romet et al., 1990)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1909","Mucociliary Clearance, Decreased","KE 1909","In healthy adults, tracheal mucus movement varies from 4 to &gt;20 mm/min (Stannard and O&#39;Callaghan, 2006), whereas mucociliary clearance (MCC) in the small airways is slower due to the lower number of ciliated cells (fewer cilia) and their shorter length (Foster et al., 1980; Iravani, 1969; Wanner et al., 1996).
Since optimal MCC is dependent in multiple factors, including cilia number and structure as well as ASL and mucus properties, any disturbances of these can lead to impaired MCC. While high humidity or infection can enhance MCC, long-term exposure to noxious substances (e.g. cigarette smoke) lead to decreased mucus clearance from the airways. In most instances this is reflected by decreased mucus transport rates or velocities."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1911","FOXJ1 Protein, Decreased","KE 1911","The epithelium of the respiratory tract has a powerful defense mechanism against air-borne pollutants due to the combined performance of mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated cells that are covered with microtubule-based projections, the cilia. In response to various irritants and pathogens mucus is secreted by goblet cells, and cilia sweep mucus upward by coordinated beating motions thus clearing the airways from these substances. The ciliated airway epithelial cells are typically covered by hundreds of motile cilia. Cilia formation is initiated and coordinated by a distinct gene expression program, led by the transcription factor forkhead box J1 (FOXJ1) (Brody et al., 2000; Zhou and Roy, 2015). In addition to the respiratory tract, FOXJ1 is expressed also in the ciliated cells of the reproductive and central nervous systems (Blatt et al., 1999; Hackett et al., 1995; Lim et al., 1997). 

The multiple motile cilia assembly factors MCIDAS and GMNC converge in positive regulation of FOXJ1 (Arbi et al., 2016; Berta et al., 2016; Stubbs et al., 2012), whereas NOTCH signaling, IL-13-or EGF (epidermal growth factor)-triggered signaling antagonize FOXJ1-driven multiciliogenesis (Gerovac and Fregien, 2016; Gerovac et al., 2014; Gomperts et al., 2007; Shaykhiev et al., 2013). Various other factors are involved in multiple motile cilia assembly, including MYB (acts early in multiciliogenesis downstream of MCIDAS), RFX3 (can act as a co-factor for FOXJ1), ULK4 (modulates the expression of FOXJ1), Wnt signaling, etc. (Choksi et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016; Schmid et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2013). Most of these factors act upstream or parallel to FOXJ1. FOXJ1 appears to be the major factor in multiciliogenesis, whereby its activity is necessary and also sufficient for programming cells to assemble functional motile cilia (Vij et al., 2012).

FOXJ1 is a master regulator of motile ciliogenesis and is essential to program cells to grow motile cilia (Zhou and Roy, 2015). This key event represents the decrease in the levels or absence of FOXJ1 protein in cells of the respiratory tract. The decrease in FOXJ1 levels inhibits ciliogenesis in multiciliated cells of zebrafish and Xenopus (Stubbs et al., 2008). The knockdown of FOXJ1 results in almost complete absence of cilia in mouse epithelial cells (Brody et al., 2000; Chen J. et al., 1998). On the other hand, the overexpression of FOXJ1 rescues cigarette smoke-mediated suppression of cilia growth in human airway epithelium (Brekman et al., 2014)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/192","Altered, Neurophysiology","KE 192","Discrete parts of nerve cells, single neurons, simple circuits, and complex brain systems have been used to evaluate the impact of thyroid disruption on brain function.  The nervous system functions as a highly integrated and organized communication and information processing network. Neurons transmit and receive information from sensory and motor organs, but the largest number of neuronal connections is with other neurons. This is largely accomplished by chemical transmission across the synaptic cleft, the space where the specialized ending of the presynaptic axon terminus of the transmitting neuron meets the specialized postsynaptic region of the neuron that is receiving that information. Activation of the presynaptic neuron to produce an action potential causes the release of neurotransmitter substances into the synaptic cleft. Most of the released neurotransmitters bind with molecules at receptors on the dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron. The chemical signal is then transduced back into an electrical impulse which travels in the receiving neuron and if of sufficient magnitude, fires the neuron, and the signal is transduced once again to a chemical signal in the next neuron along the pathway. The scale of neurophysiological techniques that can be used ranges along a broad continuum from the very small (e.g., individual ion channel fluxes) to the very large anatomical pathways (e.g., electroencephalograms) in both in vitro and in vivo preparations. 
A number of studies on TH and brain function have incorporated field potentials in the hippocampus, an area critical for certain forms of learning and memory, to probe functional integrity after TH insufficiency (e.g., Dong et al., 2005;  Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Opazo et al., 2008; Vara et al.,  2002). Field potentials have been recorded following thyroid disruption both in vivo and in vitro, at two discrete hippocampal synaptic regions, area CA1 and the dentate gyrus. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission are assessed by recording electrical field potentials (voltage changes across large populations of neurons) across a monosynaptic circuit (e.g. axons from cortical neurons that synapse on dentate gyrus granule cells) in response to electrical pulses delivered to the incoming pathway (Gilbert and Burdette, 1995).
The synapses in this region of the brain are also intensely studied as they are imbued with a capacity for use-dependent plasticity, the best studied model being long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is a model of information acquisition (learning) and storage (memory) at the synaptic level. It is induced by applying trains of stimulus pulses at high frequencies to the incoming pathway of the monosynaptic circuit and measuring the amplitude of the induced change in synaptic responsiveness that persists for hours, and in some instances days to weeks (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999; Martinez and Derrick, 1996; Gilbert and Burdette, 1995). The induction of LTP is believed to emulate, both at the synaptic and molecular level, the coincident firing of large numbers of neurons that are engaged during a learning event. The persistence of LTP emulates the duration of the memory of that learning event.
Field potentials are recorded from slices of hippocampus taken from exposed animals, or from indwelling electrodes placed within the appropriate hippocampal field. One electrode is placed in the afferent fiber pathway (e.g., perforant path for dentate gyrus, Schaeffer collaterals for CA1 region) and a brief electrical pulse applied to stimulate these axons. A second electrode is placed in the synaptic or cell body region to record the activity evoked by the incoming pulse. Electrodes are placed visually according to established landmarks in in vitro preparations, and acccording to stereotaxic coordinates for in vivo preparations. Once accurately placed, a series of stimulus pulses at increasing stimulus current intensities are applied to the input pathway, and the response evoked in the receiving neuronal population is recorded. 
Excitatory Synaptic Transmission: Two measures, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the population spike are derived from the compound field potential in response to a series of single pulse stimulations applied at increasing stimulus strengths. The function described by the relationship of current strength (input) and evoked response (output), the I-O curve is the measure of excitatory synaptic transmission.
Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission: Pairs of stimulus pulses delivered in close temporal proximity is used to probe the integrity of inhibitory synaptic transmission. The response evoked by the second pulse of the pair at brief intervals (&lt;30msec) arrives during the activation of feedback inhibitory loops in the hippocampus. An alteration in the degree of suppression to the 2nd pulse of the pair reflects altered inhibitory synaptic function.
Long Term Potentiation (LTP): Synaptic plasticity in the form of LTP is assessed by delivering trains of high frequency stimulation to induce a prolonged augmentation of synaptic responsivity. Probe stimuli at mid-range stimulus strenghts are delivered before and after application of LTP-inducing trains. The degree of increase in EPSP and PS amplitude to the probe stimulus after train application, and the longevity of that induced enhancement are metrics of LTP. Additionally, contrasting I-O functions of excitatory synaptic transmission before and after (1-5 hours) LTP is induced is also a common measure of induced LTP.
Assays of this type are fit for purpose, have been well accepted in the literature, and are reproducible across laboratories.  The assay directly measures the key event of altered neurophysiological function."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1939","Viral infection and host-to-host transmission, proliferated","KE 1939","Much is now understood in terms of human-to-human COVID-19 transmission. Coronaviruses, as with many other respiratory viruses, are transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets, but can also spread through aerosols, fecal-oral transmission, or contact with contaminated surfaces (Harrison et al. 2020). Respiratory droplets and aerosols containing the virus are generated through an infected person coughing, sneezing or talking, and enter the secondary host system through upper and lower respiratory tissues, with the lung being the primary tropism. Barriers to transmission in place worldwide include social distancing, face shields, cloth masks, frequent hand washing, and surface disinfection (Harrison et al. 2020). 

Widespread testing and contact tracing were later instituted, and more effective (medical-grade) masks also became available (Fritz et al., 2023). Fritz et al. (2023) determined that the most effective control measure in reducing COVID-19 spread is a comprehensive testing strategy, until vaccination levels can establish herd immunity.

Vaccination is the standard strategy for reducing or eliminating viral disease transmission, symptoms, and mortality in humans, and in some cases domesticated animals. COVID-19 vaccines were developed using mRNA technology to deliver the viral spike protein sequence against which the host would develop antibodies. The first to gain Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna vaccines in December 2020 (Katella, 2023). The effectiveness of the vaccines is monitored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2023) with criteria as follows:


	Hospitalization for COVID-19 or medically attended COVID-19 (e.g., emergency department visits)
	Death due to COVID-19
	Post-COVID Conditions and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS)
	Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection


Prevention of transmission is not part of this monitoring program, however, recent studies have estimated vaccination effect on transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 alpha and delta variants. Vaccines BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (a vaccine developed at Oxford University, England, using an adenoviral vector) were found to be less effective in preventing transmission than preventing serious disease outcomes. Variation in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle-threshold (Ct) values in index patients, which indicate viral load, explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in index-to-secondary patient transmission for the two variants (Eyre et al., 2022). This means viral load was not the only factor in transmission, and other factors associated with positive PCR tests in contacts included the type of exposure between patients and contacts and the age of the index patient. The highest rates of PCR positivity were seen after household exposures of index patients at least 40 years old compared with exposures at the workplace, educational facilities, or events (Eyre et al., 2022). Braeye et al. (2023) in a 2020-21 Belgian contact tracing study showed vaccine effectiveness against transmission (VET) for BNT162b2 for primary vaccination at 96% against Alpha, 87% against Delta and 31% against Omicron. A booster elevated protection against Omicron to 68%, but 150&ndash;200 days after booster-vaccination protection waned somewhat for Delta to 71% and for Omicron to 55% (Braeye et al., 2023).

Different control measures will be required to prevent future spillover from the reservoir species (bats in the case of betacoronaviruses) and potential intermediate host species. Indeed, the original intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has yet to be identified (Delahay et al. 2021). However, Wuhan, China, was the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and Worobey et al. (2022) reported that live animals, many of which proved to be susceptible to the virus, were sold at the Huanan Wholesale Market in Wuhan in late 2019. Worobey et al. (2022) found SARS-CoV-2-positive environmental samples associated with the spaces where the live animals were housed. These animals included raccoon dogs and red foxes (species shown to transmit the virus; Table 1), and other species related to known transmitters like the mink (members of the Mustelidae family including the Asian badger and hog badger).

This key event is therefore focused primarily on the species of potential concern, exposure and transmission routes across species, and the conditions indicative of or conducive toward cross-species spillover of zoonoses or infectious viral diseases of animal origin.

Species of Potential Concern

The reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses is believed to be the bat. See Table 1 below for species known to transmit SARS-CoV-2.

Exposure and Transmission Routes

SARS-CoV-2-infected media (respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, tissues, feces): Exposure routes are the pathway into the body of the virus shed from an infected reservoir host animal to the intermediate host, or either type of host animal to humans. These routes may include inhalation, oral, or through broken skin or mucosal membranes (e.g., eyes, nostrils) after touching contaminated media or surfaces and then touching the face (Harrison et al. 2020). Animals may transfer saliva or nasal discharge directly through facial contact, licking or biting. Transmission occurs through these routes when the virus reaches a tissue with cells that allow entry and replication.

Spillover Conditions

Conditions that allow for exposure and transmission across species:


	Close proximity of animal communities (bats to potential intermediate hosts; wildlife to domestic animal farms).
	Direct human contact with wildlife (Kreuder Johnson et al. 2015), including:
	
		Zoos, wildlife farms, domesticated animal farms, feeding and animal care;
		Hunting and dressing wild game;
		Cleaning of storage buildings, barns, or other structures that may be used by wildlife for shelter, breeding, or feeding, with potential for feces or other contamination (CDC, 2021);
		Wet markets where live animals or bush meat are traded;
		Research facilities that express viruses from wild samples in cell culture, that house potential host species, or that collect and store bodily fluid or tissue samples. 
	
	
	Virus isolated from animal species shows genomic similarity to the human virus, but also high host plasticity to be capable of cross-species viral immune evasion and replication (Kreuder Johnson et al. 2015).
	Spillover species and new host species share genetic similarity in the components of the cell entry, immune system and replication machinery (Warren et al. 2019). That is, the virus can enter the cell and evade the virus detection and immediate systemic type I interferon (IFN) response to allow replication and generation of viral load in both species. The viral proteins must be capable of interacting with the appropriate cellular proteins in either species. The most studied and considered indicative of infectability is the ACE2 and other cell entry proteins."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1940","Increases in cellular reactive oxygen species","KE 1940","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) refers to chemical species superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and their secondary reactive products. In the biological context, ROS are signaling molecules with important roles in cell energy metabolism, cell proliferation and fate. Therefore, balancing ROS levels at the cellular and tissue level is an important part of many biological processes. Disbalance, mainly increase of ROS levels, can cause cell dysfunction and irreversible cell damage.

ROS are produced from both exogenous stressors and normal endogenous cellular processes, such as the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Inhibition of the ETC can result in the accumulation of ROS. Exposure to chemicals, heavy metal ions, or ionizing radiation can also result in increased production of ROS. Chemicals and heavy metal ions can deplete cellular antioxidants reducing the cell&rsquo;s ability to control cellular ROS and resulting in the accumulation of ROS. Cellular antioxidants include glutathione (GSH), protein sulfhydryl groups, superoxide dismutase (SOD). 

ROS are radicals, ions, or molecules that have a single unpaired electron in their outermost shell of electrons, which can be categorized into two groups: free oxygen radicals and non-radical ROS [Liou et al., 2010].

Potential sources of ROS include NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, mitochondria, nitric oxide synthase, cytochrome P450, lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase, and monoamine oxidase [Granger, et al., 2015]. ROS are generated through NADPH oxidases consisting of p47phox and p67phox. ROS are generated through xanthine oxidase activation in sepsis [Ramos, et al., 2018]. Arsenic produces ROS [Zhang et al., 2011]. Mitochondria-targeted paraquat and metformin mediate ROS production [Chowdhury, et al., 2020]. ROS are generated by bleomycin [Lu, et al., 2010]. Radiation induces dose-dependent ROS production [Ji, et al., 2019]. 

ROS are generated in the course of cellular respiration, metabolism, cell signaling, and inflammation [Dickinson and Chang 2011; Egea, et al. 2017]. Hydrogen peroxide is also made by the endoplasmic reticulum in the course of protein folding. Nitric oxide (NO) is produced at the highest levels by nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells and phagocytes. NO production is one of the main mechanisms by which phagocytes kill bacteria [Wang et al., 2017]. The other species are produced by reactions with superoxide or peroxide, or by other free radicals or enzymes.

ROS activity is principally local. Most ROS have short half-lives, ranging from nano- to milliseconds, so diffusion is limited, while reactive nitrogen species (RNS) nitric oxide or peroxynitrite can survive long enough to diffuse across membranes [Calcerrada, et al. 2011]. Consequently, local concentrations of ROS are much higher than average cellular concentrations, and signaling is typically controlled by colocalization with redox buffers [Dickinson and Chang 2011; Egea, et al. 2017]. 

Although their existence is limited temporally and spatially, ROS interact with other ROS or with other nearby molecules to produce more ROS and participate in a feedback loop to amplify the ROS signal, which can increase RNS. Both ROS and RNS also move into neighboring cells and ROS can increase intracellular ROS signaling in neighboring cells [Egea, et al. 2017]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/195","Inhibition, NMDARs","KE 195","Biological state: L-glutamate (Glu) is a neurotransmitter with important role in the regulation of brain development and maturation processes. Two major classes of Glu receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic, have been identified. Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are integral membrane proteins formed by four large subunits that compose a central ion channel pore. In case of NMDA receptors, two NR1 subunits are combined with either two NR2 (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) subunits and less commonly are assembled together with a combination of NR2 and NR3 (A, B) subunits (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). 
To be activated NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of both glutamate to NR2 subunits and of glycine to either NR1 or NR3 subunits that provide the specific binding sites named extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Apart from LBDs, NMDA receptor subunits contain three more domains that are considered semiautonomous: 1) the extracellular amino-terminal domain that plays important role in assembly and trafficking of these receptors; 2) the transmembrane domain that is linked with LBD and contributes to the formation of the core of the ion channel and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain that influences membrane targeting, stabilization, degradation and post-translation modifications.
Biological compartments: The genes of the NMDAR subunits are expressed in various tissues and are not only restricted to the nervous system. The level of expression of these receptors in neuronal and non-neuronal cells depends on: transcription, chromatin remodelling, mRNA levels, translation, stabilization of the protein, receptor assembly and trafficking, energy metabolism and numerous environmental stimuli (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010).
In hippocampus region of the brain, NR2A and NR2B are the most abundant NR2 family subunits. NR2A-containing NMDARs are mostly expressed synaptically, while NR2B-containing NMDARs are found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999).
General role in biology: NMDA receptors, when compared to the other Glu receptors, are characterized by higher affinity for Glu, slower activation and desensitisation kinetics, higher permeability for calcium (Ca2+) and susceptibility to potential-dependent blockage by magnesium ions (Mg2+). NMDA receptors are involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS).
Functions of NMDA receptors:
1. They are involved in cell signalling events converting environmental stimuli to genetic changes by regulating gene transcription and epigenetic modifications in neuronal cells (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008).
2. In NMDA receptors, the ion channel is blocked by extracellular Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, allowing the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell which is voltage-dependent. Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptor is considered to play a critical role in pre- and post-synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism important for learning and memory (Barria and Malinow, 2002).
3. The NMDA receptors have been shown to play an essential role in the strengthening of synapses and neuronal differentiation, through long-term potentiation (LTP), and the weakening of synapses, through long-term depression (LTD). All these processes are implicated in the memory and learning function (Barria and Malinow, 2002)."

Active CASP1 cleaves GSDMD, and also cleaves and thus activates pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1B (IL1B) and IL18 [2]. N-terminal cleaved domain of GSDMD forms pores in the plasma membrane leading to cell swelling and pyroptotic cell death [3, 4].

Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) controls the transport of cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane(Stocco, 2000). There are several pathways involved for the transport of cholesterol from different subcellular pools into the inner mitochondria(Martin et al., 2016).

Biological compartments: Cholesterol is one type of lipid which is crystalline solid with yellow colour.  It is biosynthesized by animal cells and is an essential structural component of animal cell membranes (Hanukoglu, 1992). It is the precursor molecule for the synthesis all steroid hormones(Payne and Hales, 2004).  Cytochrome P450 enzymes are present in most tissues of the body, and play important roles in hormone synthesis in mitochondria using cholesterol as precursor(Poderoso et al., 2013).

General role in biology:  It is been reported that high  in cholesterol levels in mitochondrial resulted several diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, steatohepatitis ischemia, and influence disease (Martin et al., 2016). The alteration in mitochondrial cholesterol import may change the cholesterol concentrations that may lead to proper mitochondrial function along with biophysical properties of mitochondrial membranes. In absence of StAR protein, cholesterol transport into the mitochondria did not occurs leading to  no conversion of progesterone from cholesterol precursors doesn&rsquo;t occur(Kiriakidou et al., 1996; Pescador et al., 1996). All Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) promoters contain steroidogenic factor 1 binding sites which is responsible for sex hormones regulation(Manna et al., 2002).

One of the important function of the steroid hormones is maintaining reproductive capacity. For this purpose, steroidogenic cells must move large amounts of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner membrane. In the granulosa cells, this cholesterol is ultimately converted to progesterone. The initial transport of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane requires Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR) protein. Expression of StAR protein in preovulatory cells of the developing follicle is low. The dramatic upregulation of StAR protein expression within the dominant follicle is found after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. This upregulation allows the corpus luteum to produce substantial amounts of progesterone to maintain the reproductive capacity in human/animal (Men et al., 2017; Stocco, 2000)."

Estradiol stimulates both cell growth and cholesterogenesis in the MCF-7 line (breast cancer cell line) (Cypriani et al., 1988). Cholesterol increases neuronal estradiol release into the medium through synapse formation(Fester et al., 2009).

Biological compartments: Estrogen is considered as the risk of developing cholesterol gallstones by enhancing the hepatic secretion of biliary cholesterol leading to an increase in cholesterol(Wang et al., 2009).

General role in biology: When estrogen levels decline, levels of low-density lipoprotein, the harmful kind of cholesterol increases, and levels of high-density lipoprotein, the positive kind of cholesterol decrease, due to which fat build up in the body and cholesterol in the arteries that causes heart attack and stroke(F&aring;hraeus, 1988; Wahl et al., 1983).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1980","Increased microRNA expression","KE 1980","Biological state

The elevation of microRNA (miRNA) levels as a consequence of mutations and chromosomal aberrations is a multifaceted outcome stemming from the intricate regulatory dynamics of gene expression. These genetic alterations can trigger a cascade of events that influence miRNA expression. Mutations and aberrations in regulatory regions can lead to increased transcription of miRNA genes, augmenting the production of precursor miRNAs. Moreover, copy number changes resulting from chromosomal aberrations, such as gene amplification, can amplify the output of miRNA genes, ultimately boosting mature miRNA levels. Disruptions in genes responsible for miRNA processing can perturb the biogenesis pathway, leading to the accumulation of precursor miRNAs and subsequent rise in mature miRNA abundance. In parallel, altered regulatory interactions and epigenetic modifications brought about by genetic changes can free miRNA genes from their constraints, promoting enhanced expression. Additionally, miRNA-mediated feedback loops, influenced by mutations, can indirectly influence miRNA levels. This complex interplay underscores how genetic alterations can reshape the miRNA landscape, potentially influencing downstream gene expression patterns and contributing to diverse cellular outcomes and disease processes.

Genome integrity must be maintained for the proper functioning and survival of an organism.  There has been an efficient and rapid response developed by the eukaryotic cells to DNA damage  to overcome the harmful effects.  As soon as the DNA damage or replication arrest is detected, the  activation of cell cycle checkpoint and  stopping the progress of the cell cycle thus providing time for the cell to  repair the DNA damage.  The response to  DNA damage  also leads to transcriptional regulation, activation of DNA repair, and, in severe cases, initiation of apoptosis (Harper, J.W., and Elledge, S.J. , 2007). Expression of miRNAs may be regulated by the DNA damage response. A study reported that  that micro RNA expression is a  a partially ATM / ATR-independent manner(Pothof, J. et al , 2009). Subsequent studies have shown that the tumor suppressor p53 promotes PrimeRNA processing via  RNA helicase p68 (Suzuki, H.I et al, 2009).

Han et al evaluated miRNA expression pattern in a DNA damage regulatory protein, DDX1 in controls, as well in DDX1-knockdown U2OS cells with the help of reverse transcription quantitative-PCR (qRT-PCR) and human miRNA array (Han C et al, 2014). The study noticed a significant reduction in the expression levels of a subset of miRNAs -200 family such as miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429 (cut-off &gt;2-fold).d miR-429). The ovarian cancer genomics study revealed a 8-miRNA signature that defines the mesenchymal subtype of serous ovarian cancer (Yang Y, et al, 2011). Among the eight miRNAs, miR-200a, miR-29c, miR-141 and miR-101 were significantly dependent on DDX1, suggesting that DDX1 may play a role in ovarian tumor progression. Nuclear run-on assays were performed to determine whether DDX1 regulates the miRNA expression at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, No notable differences were seen in the transcription of pri-miR-200s from the two miR-200 gene clusters (miR-200a/200b/429 and miR-200c/141) in the control and DDX1-silenced cells . However, in the DDX1-knockdown U2OS cells, the levels of mature DDX1-dependent miRNAs, but not control miR-21, were significantly decreased. Due to the potential inhibition of miRNA processing activity, primary transcripts of the DDX1-dependent miRNAs were accumulated. Conversely, these DDX1-dependent miRNAs were up-regulated in the DDX1- overexpressing cells.  The above findings suggested that expression of specific miRNAs was promoted by DDX1 at the post-transcriptional level.

General role in biology: 

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that contain approximately 22 nucleotides. They function as major regulators of various biological processes, and their dysregulation is associated with many diseases, including cancer.

Cells trigger a specific cellular responses to preserve the integrity of the genome.  The  DNA damage response (DDR) is one among them along with several distinct DNA repair pathways.Normal cells need to repair DNA damage through various repair mechanisms or induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest if repair is not possible [Jackson SP and Bartek J, 2009]. Genomic instability and mutagenesis  are brought about by the disruption of repair mechanisms.DNA damage response (DDR) determines the fate of the cell and controls microRNAs expression. This will  in turn  regulate important components of the DNA repair machinery. Various reports suggest the key  role of miRNA  in the regulation of the DDR [d&rsquo;Adda di Fagagna F, 2014 and WeiW et al 2012].The DDR and DNA damage are known regulators of miRNA expression [Sharma V et al 2013 and Chowdhury D et al 2013]. Several studies have shown that the cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs is affected by  DDR- miRNA network.[ van Jaarsveld MT et al 2014]. 

A bidirectional relationship between miRNAs and the DDR has been suggested by studies. The DDR is a known regulator of miRNA expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and miRNA-mediated gene silencing has been shown to modulate the activity of the DDR [d&rsquo;Adda di Fagagna F, 2014 ; WeiW et al 2012 and Han C  et al 2012]. A unique set of miRNAs as well as a common core miRNA signature are activated depending on DNA damage type and level,  suggesting that miRNAs regulate the DDR by mechanisms based on the type and/or the intensity of DNA damage [Han C  et al 2012]. miRNAs expression  may be regulated by transcription factors either  binding directly  to miRNA promoters and modulating their transcriptional activity, or by modifying the expression of miRNA processing machinery components. 

  Studies have widely explored the TP53-mediated transcriptional pathways regulating miRNA expression following DNA damage. miRNA-34a-c is induced by DNA damage and oncogenic stress, is one of the transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor TP53 [Hermeking H et al 2012]. TP53 directly binds to the promoter of miRNA-34 and activates transcription. Micro  RNA-34 has been reported to repress the mRNA transcripts of several genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cell proliferation and survival, such as BCL2, CCND1 CCNE2, MYC, CDK4, CDK6 and SIRT1 [Hermeking H et al 2012]. Activation of miRNA-34a  promotes TP53-mediated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or senescence [Hermeking H et al 2012].  miRNA-34a may target SIRT1, form a positive feedback loop of the  acetylation of TP53, expression of its transcriptional targets, regulating cell cycle and apoptosis [Hermeking H et al 2012].   The alternative pathway involving p38 MAPK signaling  also induces miR-34c [Cannell IG et al 2010]. Inhibition of miRNA 34 prevents the DNA damage induced cell cycle arrest and results in an increased DNA synthesis [Cannell IG et al 2010].

DNA damage promotes the TP53-dependent upregulation of miRNA-192, miRNA-194 and miRNA-215. The genomic region surrounding the miRNA-194/miRNA-215 cluster contains a putative TP53-binding element, indicating that these miRNAs are transcriptionally activated by TP53 [Hermeking H et al 2012]. The expression of miRNA-192 and miRNA-215 induces cell cycle arrest and targets several transcripts involved in cell cycle checkpoints [Georges SA et al 2008].

MYC and E2F, are the two other transcription factors involved in DNA damage- induced cell cycle checkpoints, that  regulate the expression of several miRNAs. Both factors induce transcription of the miRNA-17-92 cluster that forms a feedback loop by inhibiting E2F expression [Aguda BD et al 2008]. E2F transcription factors are repressed by several other miRNAs, including miRNA-106a-92 and miRNA-106b-25 cluster members, miRNA-210, miRNA-128, miRNA-34 and miRNA-20 [Wan G et al 2011].

 DNA damage upregulates several miRNAs, including miRNA-16-1, miRNA-143 and miRNA-145. [Suzuki HI et al 2009]. Most TP53 mutations found in cancers are located in a domain required for miRNA processing and transcriptional activity [Suzuki HI et al 2009]. Thus, loss of TP53 functions in miRNAs transcription and processing might contribute to cancer progression. Considering that some miRNAs are reduced after DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner, ATM could be also involved in inhibitory pathways that downregulate miRNA expression [Wang Y et al 2013]. These findings support the existence of a critical link between the DDR and miRNA processing pathway.

 In the DNA damage response, post-transcriptional processing of miRNAs is also regulated. It was reported that DNA damage led to increased levels of some pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs without significant changes of levels of their primary transcripts, suggesting posttranscriptional mechanisms could contribute to the induction of certain miRNAs under DNA damage stress [Zhang X, et al 2011]. There appears to be functional connections between DNA damage response and miRNA processing and maturation.

Micro RNA - 18a, miR-100, miR-101, miR-181, and miR-421, have been implicated as novel regulators to control the protein level of ATM (Majid S et al 2010). BRCA1, a critical tumor suppressor, BRCA1, is also recruited to DNA damage lesions, where it facilitates DNA repair. The level of BRCA1 is regulated by miR-182, miR-146a, and 146b-5p (Matsui M et al 2013).

The tumor suppressor p53 has a central role in the activation of genes in multiple pathways, including cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, and apoptosis. Micro RNA-125b and miR-504 have been identified as negative regulators of p53 in several types of human cells (Kreis S et al 2008 and Wang J et al 2012). 

The available evidence suggests that DNA damage signaling participates in miRNA biogenesis by regulating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Further studies can through light on the correlation between DNA damaging signaling and miRNA processing. The majority of the studies have examined the miRNA regulation in response to DNA damage and have focused on events that occur in the nucleus. It is important to extend the investigations in understanding the contribution of cytoplasmic regulation of miRNA biogenesis following DNA damage. It is very interesting to determine whether DNA damage signals can modulate the turnover, stabilization, modification, and degradation of miRNAs."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1981","Decreased SIRT1 expression","KE 1981","Biological state: 

Mammalian SIRTs include seven proteins (SIRT1-7) with deacetylase activity belonging to the class III histone deacetylase family. SIRTs share homology with the yeast deacetylase Sir2, and have different sequences and lengths in both their N- and C-terminal domains (Carafa, V. et al 2012). Expressed from bacteria to humans (Vaquero, A. 2009), SIRTs target histone and non-histone proteins.

Localization of SIRTs is restricted to mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus     The location of SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7  is predominantly in the nucleus,  while SIRT2 in the cytosol, and SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are in the mitochondria.  Depending on their role in regulating different pathways,  SIRTs relocalize under different conditions such as  cell cycle phase, tissue type, developmental stage, stress condition, and metabolic status which has been documented in the literature. (McGuinness, D. et al 2011).  As per Mitchishita et al, SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7 are often found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Michishita, E et al 2005).

 Cellular pathways  like DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, metabolism, aging, and senescence are modulated by Sirtuins. This has  created  sufficient interest with Sirtuins as target in cancer research as the above mentioned functions are involved in initiation and progression of cancer. Evidence have suggested the association of SIRTs with metabolism-associated TFs, MYC and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),  in terms of  energy metabolic reprogramming.( Zwaans, B. M. et al 2014)

  The biological effect of SIRTs in cancer is either tumor suppression  or tumor promoter (oncogenes) action by altering the cell proliferation, differentiation, and death which in turn depends on cell context and experimental conditions.   These two totally opposite function of SIRTs on cancer cell is remains a highly debated and controversial topic. Whether SIRTs act as tumor suppressors or promoters depends on (i) their  The different expression levels of SIRTS in tumors and its effects on cell cycle, cell growth,  death, their action on specific proto-oncogene and onco-suppressor proteins will determine SIRTs role as  tumor suppressor or tumor promoters  (Deng, C. X. 2009).

Sirtuin Reactions

The NAD+-dependent deacetylation is well known enzymatic reaction catalyzed by SIRTs. Deacetylation reaction begins with amide cleavage from NAD+ with the formation of nicotinamide and an intermediate of reaction, O-ADP-ribose. This intermediate formed is necessary for the deacetylation process by which SIRTs catalyze the transfer of one acetyl group from a lysine to O-ADP-ribose moiety to form O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and the deacetylated lysine product. This reaction requires a mole equivalent of NAD+ per acetyl group removed and is controlled by the cellular [NAD]/[NADH] ratio (Sauve, A. A. 2010 and Shi, Y. et al 2013).

Among the SIRTs family, only SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 possess a robust deacetylase activity even though SIRT enzymes are primarily known as protein deacetylases. SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6, and SIRT7) exhibit a weak or no detectable deacetylation activity at all.Through these reactions, SIRTs are able to regulate several key cellular processes (Jiang, H., et al 2013 and Zhang, S. et al 2017).

 

 

Biological compartments: 

Regulation of gene expression takes place in the cell, subcellular site being nucleus.

 

 

General role in biology: 

Silent Inflammation Regulator 2 (SIR2) proteins belong to the  family of histone deacetylases (HDACs) that catalyze deacetylation of both histone and non- histone lysine residues.

Mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are involved in  diverse biological processes including energy metabolism,  lifespan and health span regulation (Longo VD et al 2006). Mammalian sirtuins possess will bring about an array of biological functions through its enzymatic activity such as  histone deacetylase, mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, desuccinylase, demalonylase, demyristoylase, and depalmitoylase activity (Michan S et al 2007). SIRT1 located  in the nucleus play an important role in genomic stability, telomere maintenance, and cell survival (Chen J et al 2011 and, Haigis MC et al 2006). 

 

Among the 7 SIRTs, SIRT1 is the largest in terms of total DNA and amino acid sequence studied sirtuin [Fang, Y. and M.B. Nicholl 2011]. SIRT1, a class 3 histone deacetylase, is implicated in the modulation of apoptosis, senescence, proliferation, and aging. It&rsquo;s actions arebrought about by cellular nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+) which acts as a cofactor for deacetylation reactivity. The liberated nicotinamide from NAD+, generates a  novel metabolite o-acetyl-ADP-ribose . SIRT1 can mediate  the actions at translational level. Various mechanisms have been  proposed to be  involved in dysregulation of SIRT1 in cancer cells  [Yao, C., et al.2016]. In human breast, lung and prostate cancers SIRT1 is significantly elevated . It plays  a role in tumorigenesis by anti-apoptotic activity through oncogene and epigenetic regulator action.[ Saunders, L. and E. Verdin 2007]. SIRT1 deacetylates pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53 and promotes cell survival under genotoxic and oxidative stresses [Kojima, K., et al 2010]. It&rsquo;s critical role in multiple aspects of resistance to anti-cancer drugs is also well documented [Duan, K., et al 2015]. Therefore, SIRT1 overexpression is associated with the subsequent higher level of tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration [Wang, X., et al 2016].

SIRT1 expression is increased in human colon cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and some skin can- cers (Bradbury, C. A et al 2005, Hida, Y. et al 2007, Huffman, D. M. et al 2007 and Stunkel, W.2007). SIRT1 , by interacting with and inhibiting p53  may act as tumor promoter (van Leeuwen, I., and Lain, S. 2009). Repression of tumor suppression protein expression and DNA repair protein ,are other roles of  SIRT1 in cancer cells.  In colon cancer ,  SIRT1 limits &beta;-catenin signaling while in breast cancer it interacts with  BRCA1 signaling . However it has been observed that  SIRT1 expression is decreased in  ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, and bladder carcinoma (Deng, C. X. 2009).  In these cancers , SIRT1 might serve as a tumor suppressor by blocking oncogenic pathways. Thus SIRT1 can serve as a tumor promoter or tumor suppressor, depending on the oncogenic pathways specific to particular tumors.

In hepatocellular carcinoma , SIRT1 was overexpressed in HCC cells and tissues, and significantly promoted the migration and invasion ability of HCC cells by inducing the epithelial and �mesenchymal transition[Hao C et al 2014]. This in vivo study  also supported the oncogenic functions of SIRT1 in enhancing metastasis[Hao C et al 2014]. Bae et al [Bae HJ et al 2014] found that knockdown of SIRT1 inhibited cell growth by transcriptional deregulation of cell cycle proteins, leading to hypophosphorylation of pRb, which inactivated E2F/ DP1 target gene transcription, and thereby caused the G1/S cell cycle arrest. In addition, miR�29c was identified as a suppressor of SIRT1 by comprehensive miRNA profiling and ectopic miR�29c expression recapitulated SIRT1 knockdown effects in HCC cells [Bae HJ et al 2014].  To contradict the above findings,  Zhang et al [Zhang ZY et al 2015] reported that SIRT1 has anti�carcinogenic effects in HCC via the AMPK� mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. They evaluated the relationship between p53 mutations and activation of SIRT1 in 252 patients with hepatitis B virus �positive HCC and found that activated SIRT1 was associated with a longer recurrence free survival in HCC tissues harbouring mutant p53.  He reported that inhibition of SIRT1 increased cell growth, bearing mutated p53, by suppressing AMPK activity and enhancing mTOR activity.The conflicting results from different published data  indicated that SIRT1 is multi�functional gene and its biological features are left unsolved.

These above evidence indicates the involvement of SIRTs in regulating three important tumor processes: epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis. Many SIRTs are responsible for cellular metabolic reprogramming and drug resistance by inactivating cell death pathways and promoting uncontrolled proliferation. These observations are  for the future development of novel tailored SIRT-based cancer therapies.

Wang et al showed that SIRT1 expression was increased in several cancer cell lines, and is generally associated with poor prognosis and overall survival (Wang, C., et al 2017). Vaziri et al reported that SIRT1 interacted  with P53, triggering its deacetylation in Lys382 residue, and determined a block of all P53-dependent pathways, leading to uncontrolled cell cycle and inactivation of the apoptotic process (Vaziri, H., et al 2011).

SIRT1 has a function in metastasis and invasiveness in several cancers that has been reported in several studies. Among them ,the deacetylation of many proteins involved in tumor suppressor processes or DNA damage repair, and the inactivation of specific pathways support the role of SIRT1 as a tumor promoter. The role of  SIRT1  in the initiation, promotion, and progression of several malignant tumors including prostate cancer (Jung-Hynes, B. et al 2009), breast cancer (Jin, X., et al 2018), lung cancer (Han, L. et al 2013) and gastric cancer (Han, L. et al 2013) are well documented. Wilking el al showed in his in vitro experiments that the inhibition of SIRT1 by treatment with small molecule SIRT1 inhibitors determines a significant decrease in cell growth, proliferation and viability (Wilking, M. J., et al 2014)."

Biological state: 

Metastasis, the process by which cancer cells spread from their site of origin to distant organs or tissues, is a complex and multifaceted biological phenomenon that poses a significant challenge in cancer management. Cancer metastasis represents a critical stage in the progression of the disease, often leading to poorer patient outcomes and decreased survival rates. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying metastasis is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies to combat advanced-stage cancers.

At the biological level, metastasis involves a series of sequential steps that cancer cells must undergo to successfully disseminate and colonize distant sites within the body. These steps include local invasion of surrounding tissues by cancer cells, intravasation into nearby blood or lymphatic vessels, survival and transport through the circulation, extravasation into distant tissues, and establishment of secondary tumors through proliferation and angiogenesis. Each of these steps is regulated by a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental factors that influence the invasive and migratory properties of cancer cells.

The metastatic process is driven by a variety of molecular alterations that confer cancer cells with the ability to invade and metastasize. Key molecular mechanisms implicated in metastasis include dysregulated signaling pathways involved in cell adhesion, motility, and invasion, as well as genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications that promote tumor progression and metastatic spread. For example, alterations in genes encoding cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, integrins, and cadherins can disrupt cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, facilitating the detachment and dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor site.

Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in regulating the metastatic behavior of cancer cells. Stromal cells, immune cells, and extracellular matrix components within the tumor microenvironment interact dynamically with cancer cells to modulate their invasive and migratory properties. Additionally, factors such as hypoxia, inflammation, and angiogenesis contribute to the formation of a pro-metastatic niche that supports the survival and outgrowth of disseminated cancer cells at distant sites.

In summary, metastasis is a complex biological process driven by genetic, molecular, and microenvironmental factors that enable cancer cells to spread and establish secondary tumors in distant organs or tissues. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of metastasis is essential for the development of targeted therapies aimed at disrupting key molecular pathways involved in this process, ultimately improving outcomes for patients with advanced-stage cancers.

Role in general biology

Metastasis, although primarily studied in the context of cancer biology, also has relevance in general biology as it reflects fundamental biological processes such as cell migration, invasion, and tissue remodeling. Understanding these processes not only sheds light on cancer progression but also provides insights into various physiological and pathological phenomena in multicellular organisms.

1. Cell Migration: Cell migration is a fundamental process in various biological contexts, including embryonic development, wound healing, and immune responses. Metastasis involves the migration of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant sites within the body, exploiting mechanisms similar to those used by normal cells during migration. Studying cancer metastasis can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell migration, including changes in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and signaling pathways that regulate cell motility.

2. Invasion and Extravasation: Cancer metastasis requires cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues, intravasate into blood or lymphatic vessels, survive in the circulation, and extravasate into distant tissues. These processes involve complex interactions between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment, including extracellular matrix components, immune cells, and stromal cells. Understanding the mechanisms of invasion and extravasation in cancer metastasis can provide insights into how cells navigate and interact with their microenvironment under physiological and pathological conditions.

3. Tissue Remodeling and Angiogenesis: Metastatic tumors undergo extensive tissue remodeling and angiogenesis to establish secondary growths at distant sites. This process involves the degradation of extracellular matrix components, the recruitment of blood vessels, and the formation of a supportive microenvironment for tumor growth. Similar processes occur during normal physiological events such as tissue repair and regeneration. By studying metastasis, researchers can gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue remodeling and angiogenesis, which are critical for understanding various biological processes beyond cancer.

4. Cell-Cell and Cell-Matrix Interactions: Metastasis involves dynamic interactions between cancer cells and neighboring cells, as well as with components of the extracellular matrix. These interactions influence cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, and are mediated by various cell adhesion molecules, receptors, and signaling pathways. Understanding the mechanisms of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in metastasis can provide insights into how cells communicate and coordinate their behavior in different biological contexts, including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and disease processes.

In conclusion, while metastasis is a hallmark of cancer progression, it also reflects fundamental biological processes that are relevant in general biology. Studying metastasis not only advances our understanding of cancer biology but also provides insights into various physiological and pathological phenomena involving cell migration, invasion, tissue remodeling, and intercellular interactions."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1983","Disruption, action potential generation","KE 1983","Generation of action potentials (APs)

The action potential is a transient depolarization and repolarization of the membrane that occurs in electrically excitable cells (neurons, cardiac cells, muscle). Due to unequal distribution of charged ions between the inside and outside of the cell, a voltage difference (potential) exists between the intracellular and extracellular sides of the cell membrane. At &ldquo;resting&rdquo; levels of activity, this membrane potential is about -70 millivolts. Typically, sodium ions are much higher outside of the cell while potassium ions are higher inside of the cell. The action potential is initiated by a depolarizing stimulus that results in the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels in the membrane. Once a few sodium channels open, this triggers local depolarization opening other nearby VGSC and induction of a rapid depolarization to positive potentials (e.g. +20 mV) of the membrane. This rapid depolarization is due to influx of positively charged sodium ions into the cell through the VGSC. Sodium channels rapidly &ldquo;inactivate&rdquo;, closing even if the membrane remains depolarized, limiting the amount of sodium entering the cell and stopping additional depolarization. The VGSC induced depolarization of the membrane causes voltage-gated potassium channels to open, which results in positively charged potassium ions exiting the cell to repolarize the membrane to its resting potential. In myelinated neurons, myelin introduces insulation around the axon that allows depolarization to spread further down the axon with great efficiency. Sodium channel expression is higher around specialized &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; in the myelin sheath, nodes of Ranvier. The high concentration of VGSCs at these nodes increase the probability that a sufficient number of VGSC will open on depolarization to reach the threshold for firing an action potential. In this manner the sequestering of VGSC at the node allows the electrical impulse to quickly jump from node to node along the length of the axon, increasing the speed of propagation of the action potential.

The process described above is highly conserved across electrically excitable cells and is described in a generic manner here. Due to the diversity of different neuron types and expression of different combinations of ion channels across those neuron types, differences in the shape and temporal patterns of APs are observed across different cells in the nervous system. The basic components of the action potential as described above are well conserved in neurons from invertebrates to vertebrates including mammals and humans.

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/201","Binding of antagonist, NMDA receptors","KE 201","Biological state: L-glutamate (Glu) is a neurotransmitter with important role in the regulation of brain development and maturation processes. Two major classes of Glu receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic, have been identified. Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are integral membrane proteins formed by four large subunits that compose a central ion channel pore. In case of NMDA receptors, two NR1 subunits are combined with either two NR2 (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) subunits and less commonly are assembled together with a combination of NR2 and NR3 (A, B) subunits (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). To be activated NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of both glutamate to NR2 subunits and of glycine to either NR1 or NR3 subunits that provide the specific binding sites named extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Apart from LBDs, NMDA receptor subunits contain three more domains that are considered semiautonomous: 1) the extracellular amino-terminal domain that plays important role in assembly and trafficking of these receptors; 2) the transmembrane domain that is linked with LBD and contributes to the formation of the core of the ion channel and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain that influences membrane targeting, stabilization, degradation and post-translation modifications.

Biological compartments: The genes of the NMDAR subunits are expressed in various tissues and are not only restricted to the nervous system. The level of expression of these receptors in neuronal and non-neuronal cells depends on: transcription, chromatin remodelling, mRNA levels, translation, stabilization of the protein, receptor assembly and trafficking, energy metabolism and numerous environmental stimuli (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010).

In hippocampus region of the brain, NR2A and NR2B are the most abundant NR2 family subunits. NR2A-containing NMDARs are mostly expressed synaptically, while NR2B-containing NMDARs are found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999).

General role in biology: NMDA receptors, when compared to the other Glu receptors, are characterized by higher affinity for Glu, slower activation and desensitisation kinetics, higher permeability for calcium (Ca2+) and susceptibility to potential-dependent blockage by magnesium ions (Mg2+). NMDA receptors are involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Functions of NMDA receptors:

1. They are involved in cell signalling events converting environmental stimuli to genetic changes by regulating gene transcription and epigenetic modifications in neuronal cells (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008).

2. In NMDA receptors, the ion channel is blocked by extracellular Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, allowing the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell which is voltage-dependent. Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptor is considered to play a critical role in pre- and post-synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism important for learning and memory (Barria and Malinow, 2002).

3. The NMDA receptors have been shown to play an essential role in the strengthening of synapses and neuronal differentiation, through long-term potentiation (LTP), and the weakening of synapses, through long-term depression (LTD). All these processes are implicated in the memory and learning function (Barria and Malinow, 2002)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/202","Inhibition, Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)","KE 202","The NF-&kappa;B pathway consists of a series of events including IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) signaling, where the transcription factors of the NF-&kappa;B family play the key role. The canonical NF-&kappa;B pathway can be activated by a range of stimuli, including TNF receptor activation by TNF-a. Upon pathway activation, the IKK complex will be phosphorylated, which in turn phosphorylates IkBa. This NF-&kappa;B inhibitor will be K48-linked ubiquitinated and degradated, allowing NF-&kappa;B to translocate to the nucleus. There, this transcription factor can express pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, negative feedback genes are also transcribed and include IkBa and A20. When the NF-&kappa;B pathway is inhibited, its translocation will be delayed (or absent), resulting in less or no regulation of NF-&kappa;B target genes. This can be achieved by IKK inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, nuclear translocation inhibitors or DNA-binding inhibitors (Gupta et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2017). Therefore, inhibition of IL-1R activation suppresses NF-&kappa;B.

 

In addition to the NF-kB pathway, IRAK activates a variety of transcription factors, including Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), Adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), resulting in the expression of broad array of inflammatory molecules and apoptosis-related proteins (Jain, 2014)."

	Sox proteins are characterized by containing the highly conserved high mobility group (HMG) domain, and around 20 different sox proteins have been discovered in mice and humans to date (Jo et al., 2014). 



	Sox9, which is part of the soxE subgroup, was initially discovered as the gene underlying campomelic dysplasia (CD), a haplosufficiency disorder characterized by abnormal chondrogenesis, as well as autosomal XY sex reversal from males to females (Wagner et al., 1994). 



	Since then, sox9 has been implicated in several functions such as in chondrogenesis, skeletal development, male gonad genesis, development of mesodermal tissues such as cardiac valves and septa, and pyloric sphincter, in ectoderm development (neural stem cells, gliogenesis, and neural stem cells), in hair follicle stem cells, retinal progenitor cells, and the otic placode, and during endoderm development impacting the pancreas, liver, intestine, and lungs. The developmental functions of sox9 have been comprehensively reviewed (Jo et al., 2014; Kawaguchi 2013; Lee and Saint-Jeannet 2011; Lefebvre and Dvir-Ginzberg 2017). 



	Several of sox9&rsquo;s functions are hypothesized to take place as a result of its role as a repressor of the Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathway. Of note, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway promotes chondrocyte differentiation in a sox9-dependent manner (Yano et al., 2005).



	Sox9b (one of two paralogs of the sox9 gene in zebrafish) is one of the most reduced transcripts in the jaw upon TCDD exposure in zebrafish which causes severe lower jaw defects (Xiong et al., 2008), supporting role of sox9&rsquo;s repression in craniofacial defects."

They inlude, for example, sphingomyelin (SM) and glycosphingolipids such as gangliosides (GM), and are essential constituents or eukaryotic membranes (Kolter and Sandhoff, 2006). Considering their biologically relevant role as components of the cell membrane and thus basal functioning of cells, a decrease in sphingolipids may result in a variety of adverse effecfts. For example, sphinoglipids have been assigned a role in the pathogenesis of various metabolic diseases (sphingolipidoses), myocardial infarction, hypertension and diabetis mellitus (Borodzicz et al., 2015; Kolter and Sandhoff, 2006)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2027","Antagonism, Smoothened receptor","KE 2027","The Smoothened (SMO) receptor is Class F G protein coupled receptor involved in signal transduction of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. It includes distinct functional groups including ligand binding pockets, cysteine rich domain (CRD), transmembrane helix (TM), extracellular loop (ECL), intracellular loop (ICL), and a carboxyl-terminal tail (C-term tail) (Arensdorf, Marada et al. 2016).  SMO signaling is dependent upon its relocation to a subcellular location. This occurs in the plasma membrane for flies (Denef, Neub&uuml;ser et al. 2000) and the primary cilium (PC) in vertebrates (Huangfu and Anderson 2005). 

In the absence of Hedgehog (HH) ligand, the Patched (PTCH) receptor suppresses the activation of SMO. When HH ligand binds to PTCH, suppression on SMO is released and SMO is  able to relocate, accumulate, and signal to intracellular effectors (Denef, Neub&uuml;ser et al. 2000). This signaling to effectors results in the activation of the GLI transcription factors and the subsequent induction of HH target gene expression(Alexandre, Jacinto et al. 1996, Von Ohlen and Hooper 1997). The exact mechanism through which PTCH and SMO interact is not known. 

An endogenous ligand for SMO has not been discovered although evidence for one exists and that PTCH controls SMO by controlling its&rsquo; availability or accessibility. To support this, it has been shown that PTCH and SMO do not physically interact (Chen and Struhl 1998). PTCH acts catalytically with SMO with one PTCH receptor capable of controlling many (~50) SMO receptors (Taipale, Cooper et al. 2002). Since PTCH includes a sterol sensing domain and shares characteristics of ancient bacterial transporters, a model of PTCH functioning by pumping a sterol-like MSO regulator has been proposed (Mukhopadhyay and Rohatgi 2014).  SMO is constitutively active in the absence of PTCH suggesting that the elusive molecule is an agonist (Rohatgi and Scott 2007). Conversely, the discovery that oxysterols bind to the CRD binding domain acting as positive modulators suggest that the molecule could be an agonist with PTCH functioning to sequester away or limit cellular concentration (Corcoran and Scott 2006, Nachtergaele, Mydock et al. 2012)

The activity of SMO is controlled by ligand binding (Kobilka 2007). Two separate binding pockets, one in the groove of the extracellular CRD and the other in the helices of the TMD have been identified (Nachtergaele, Mydock et al. 2012, Rana, Carroll et al. 2013, Wang, Wu et al. 2013, Byrne, Sircar et al. 2016, Huang, Zheng et al. 2018). These two binding pockets have been shown to interact in an allosteric manner (Nachtergaele, Mydock et al. 2012). The binding pocket in the helices of the TMD binds several SMO agonists including SAG as well as antagonists Vismodegib and Sonidegib. The CRD binding pocket binds cholesterol and its&rsquo; oxidized derivates (Byrne, Luchetti et al. 2018). The antagonist cyclopamine binds to the TMD binding pocket and inhibits SHH signal transduction. However, in mSMO carrying the mutations D477G/E552K that disable the TMD binding pocket, cyclopamine binds to the CRD pocket and activates the pathway (Huang, Nedelcu et al. 2016). To date several oxysterols including 20(S)-hydroxylcholesterol, 22(S)-hydroxylcholesterol, 7-keto-25-hydroxylcholesterol and 7-keto-27-hydroxylcholesterol have been identified as activators of SMO (Dwyer, Sever et al. 2007, Nachtergaele, Mydock et al. 2012, Myers, Sever et al. 2013). A binding site for 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol has been identified in the TMD pocket using cryo-EM of SMO in complex with 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (Qi, Liu et al. 2019)."

When SMO is activated the GLI2/3-Sufu complex is dismantled allowing for retrograde transport of GLI back into the nucleus (Kim, Kato et al. 2009). 

The GLI family is found in both a long activator form (GliA) or a proteolytically cleaved repressor form (GliR). Current understanding is that Gli3 functions primarily as a repressor while Gli1 and Gli2 function mainly as activators of the pathway and that recruitment of SMO to the cilium leads to a increase in the ratio of GliA:GliR (Hui and Angers 2011, Liu 2016)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2042","Orofacial clefting","KE 2042","Orofacial clefts (OFC) are one of the most common birth defects. Orofacial clefts are commonly divided on the anatomy they affect by clefts of the lip and/or palate (CL/P) and those of the palate only (CPO) (Murray 2002). Clefts can also be classified as either syndromic when they occur with other physical or developmental anomalies or nonsydromic in the absence of other symptoms (Stanier and Moore 2004). Like most births, the etiology of OFCs are complex and include a combination of genetic and chemical factors (Lipinski and Bushman 2010, Heyne, Melberg et al. 2015). Orofacial development is tightly regulated by multiple signaling pathways and genes including: fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs), Sonic Hedgehog (shh), bone morphogenic protein (Bmp), transforming growth factor beta (Tgf- &beta;) and transcription factors including Dlx, Pitx, Hox, Gli and T-box (Stanier and Moore 2004). Orofacial development requires precise cell migration, growth, differentiation and apoptosis to create the needed orofacial structures from the oropharyngeal membrane (Jugessur and Murray 2005).  During the sixth week of human embryogenesis the medial nasal prominences merge to form the primary palate and the upper lip. The mandibular prominences merge across the midline to produce the lower jaw and lip. Development of the secondary palate begins in the sixth week where the palatal shelves extend internally to the maxillary processes. The shelves then elevate above the tongue and grow towards each other until contact occurs. During weeks 7-8 the medial edges of the palatal shelves fuse through as series of epithelial-mesenchyme transition (EMT) and apoptosis(Jugessur and Murray 2005, Zhang, Tian et al. 2016). Disruption to the complex processes required for proper orofacial development can occur both through genetic factors and environmental (i.e. chemical) exposure by causing disruption to one or multiple steps of orofacial development resulting in OFC."

SMO signaling is dependent upon its relocation to a subcellular location. This relocation occurs in the primary cilium (PC) in vertebrates (Huangfu and Anderson 2005). Relocation of SMO to the PC typically occurs within ~20 minutes of agonist stimulation (Arensdorf, Marada et al. 2016). 

In the absence of SHH ligand, the Patched (PTCH) receptor suppresses the activation of SMO. When HH ligand binds to PTCH, suppression on SMO is released and SMO can relocate, accumulate, and signal to intracellular effectors (Denef, Neub&uuml;ser et al. 2000, Rohatgi and Scott 2007). It has been shown that SMO localization to the tip of the primary cilia is essential for the SHH signaling cascade in vertebrates (Corbit, Aanstad et al. 2005, Rohatgi, Milenkovic et al. 2007, Rohatgi, Milenkovic et al. 2009).

The exact mechanism through which PTCH and SMO interact is not known.

While we know that entry to the cilia is tightly controlled, the exact mechanism of SMO ciliary trafficking is not fully understood. The PC is separated from the plasma membrane by the ciliary pockets and the transition zone which function together to regulate the movement of lipids and proteins in and out of the organelle (Goetz, Ocbina et al. 2009, Rohatgi and Snell 2010). The SHH receptor PTCH contains a ciliary localization sequence in its&rsquo; carboxy tail. Localization of PTCH to the PC is essential for inhibition of SMO as deletion of the CLS in PTCH prevents PTCH localization as well as inhibition of SMO (Kim, Hsia et al. 2015) (53). SMO also contains a CLS, but only accumulates in the PC upon ligand binding (Corbit, Aanstad et al. 2005). The entry of SMO into the PC is thought to occur either laterally through the ciliary pockets or internally via recycling endosomes (Milenkovic, Scott et al. 2009). Once inside the PC, SMO can diffuse freely, however it will usually accumulate in specific locations depending upon its&rsquo; activation state. Inactive SMO will accumulate more at the base of the PC while active SMO will accumulate in the tip of the PC (Milenkovic, Weiss et al. 2015)."

The source of endogenous NO is L-arginine (Burov et al., 2022). Production of NO in the body can occur through nitric oxide synthase (NOS), an enzyme that degrades L-arginine in the presence of oxygen and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) (Luiking, Engelen &amp; Deutz, 2010). Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an important cofactor of NOS, allowing the enzymatic production of NO. A non-enzymatic method to produce NO includes the reduction of nitrite (Luiking, Engelen &amp; Deutz, 2010). NO is constitutively produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), and can be increased by inducible NOS (iNOS) (Powers &amp; Jackson, 2008). Changes in the expression or activity of NOS enzymes can cause changes in NO levels. For example, iNOS is mainly regulated through transcription and its upregulation can result in increased production of NO (Farah, Michel &amp; Balligand, 2018). Also, eNOS can be regulated by Ca2+ concentrations and blood flow shear stress through phosphorylation at Ser1177 (activating) and Thr495 (inhibiting) (F&ouml;rstermann, 2010)."

The vasculature is capable of detecting changes in its surroundings and maintaining homeostasis (Gibbons &amp; Dzau, 1994; Renna, Heras &amp; Miatello, 2013). The functionality of blood vessels is highly dependent on their structure, with changes in arterial morphology being associated with downstream impacts (Gibbons &amp; Dzau, 1994). Vascular remodeling is a term for many histological changes, including increased vascular stiffness, wall shear stress, intima-media thickening (IMT), increased intima-media section area, altered vascular permebility and increased vessel diameter (Bouten et al., 2021;Herity et al., 1999). As blood vessels stiffen, this impacts systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse which can be indicators of vascular remodeling. Cellular level changes characterized by processes of growth, death, migration and production or degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) result in inflammation (increase in VCAM, ICAM, cytokines, chemokines) and calcification (changes in ratios of collagen and elastin) (Gibbons &amp; Dzau, 1994). Initial tissue injury and resulting remodeling can also lead to turbulent blood flow causing further structural changes like increased vessel fibrosis.  Increased vascular remodelling is often associated with a build-up of plaque in the arteries (known as atherosclerosis) due to impaired healing, which forces the vessel walls to attempt to remodel to maintain blood flow (Sylvester et al., 2018)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2083","Occurrence of Cataracts","KE 2083","Cataracts are a progressive condition in which the lens of the eye develops opacities and becomes cloudy, resulting in blurred vision as well as glare and haloes around lights (National Eye Institute, 2022). For this AOP, a cataract is defined when over 5% of the lens is opacified. It is one of the leading causes of blindness around the world (Raj et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2017), and surgery is currently the only cure.  

The lens is a transparent, biconvex tissue located at the front of the eye. It is responsible for focusing light onto the retina, producing a clear image. However, under certain conditions, sections of the lens may develop small opacities, losing their transparency and resulting in blurred vision (Hildreth et al., 2009). As the lens has low metabolic and mitotic activity, there is very little tissue turnover. Therefore, damaged proteins that are not removed can acucmulate over time contributing to opacities and formation of cataracts (Hamada, 2017).  

A variety of factors are essential for maintaining the transparency of the lens, and therefore preventing cataracts. These include proper organization, development and balance of proteins such as crystallins (Hildreth et al., 2009; Ainsbury et al., 2016; Hamada, 2017; Wu et al., 2018), no organelles within the mature lens fiber cells (Pendergrass, 2010; Fujimichi et al., 2014; Hamada, 2017; Heitmancik &amp; Shiels, 2015), and a low water content in the lens (Ainsbury et al., 2016). Genetic factors can also play a role, such as mutations in genes coding for molecular chaperones, growth factors, gap-junction proteins, intermediated filament proteins, membrane proteins, and RNA binding proteins (Hamada &amp; Fujimichi, 2015; Lachke, 2022). When any of these factors are affected, it causes light scattering, which increases lens opacity, contributing to cataract formation and density.  

In general, there are three main categories of cataract: pediatric, age-related and those secondary to other causes. Age-related cataracts are the most common and can be subdivided into nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSC) based on which portion of the lens becomes opaque. In nuclear cataracts the opacities are in the nucleus of the lens, in cortical cataracts they are in the cortex, and in posterior subcapsular cataracts they are located beneath the posterior capsule (Van Kuijk, 1991).  Research has shown that posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataracts are a subtype of cataract that are most often found with ionizing radiation exposure. This may be due to radiation exposure causing the improperly differentiated lens epithelial cells (LECs) to leave the germinative zone (GZ) and migrate along the posterior capsule towards the center of the lens. As atypical lens fiber cells (LFCs), and atypical LECs accumulate in this area, they may cause the development of a PSC cataract (Loganovsky et al., 2020).

Cataracts can be diagnosed through several different methods and there is no universally accepted grading system. The most common grading systems are the Lens Opacities Classification System I, II, or III (LOC I, II, or III), the Modified Merriam-Focht Cataract Scoring System, and the slit lamp grading system. They classify cataracts on a scale of severity, which is often subjective, relying upon the examiner&rsquo;s judgement. However, there are some methods such as Scheimpflug imaging which are less subjective as they measure lens density (Barraquer et al., 2017; Singh Grewal &amp; Singh Grewal, 2012)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2089","Altered Bone Cell Homeostasis","KE 2089","Osteogenesis is the process by which new bone is formed through the balanced action of bone depositing osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts. Osteogenesis is regulated by the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts/clasts. Dysregulation of bone cell differentiation and functional activity leads to imbalanced osteogenesis and altered bone matrix (Smith, 2020).  

Osteoclast precursors are of hematopoietic origin and differentiated into mature, multi-nucleated osteoclasts based on external signals in the microenvironment, of which the cytokine macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, also known as CSF-1) and receptor activator of NF-&kappa;B ligand (RANKL, aka TNFSF11) are key components (Donaubauer et al., 2020; Smith, 2020). Osteoclasts bone resorbing activity is a result of enzymes expressed in cellular lysosomes that are involved in the degradation extracellular components, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), among others. Cellular lysosomes are shuttled to the resorption lacunae, located under the ruffled osteoclast membrane, from which they begin degrading the bone matrix (Lacombe, Karsenty, and Ferron, 2013; Smith, 2020).  

Osteoblasts differentiate from precursors of mesenchymal origin through various differentiation pathways activated by growth factors and signaling proteins such as bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor B (TGF-&szlig;), among others. Pre-osteoblasts migrate to the site of bone resorption, where they become fully functioning osteoblasts capable of depositing new bone matrix (Donaubauer et al., 2020). Osteoblasts will synthesize and secrete bone matrix, most importantly collagen, and participate in the mineralization of bone to regulate the balance of calcium and phosphate ions in bone. Key molecular components involved in bone formation are alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), and procollagen type I C- and N-terminal propeptides (PICP and PINP), among others (Chen, Deng, and Ling, 2012; Rowe et al., 2021)."

The term oxidative stress indicates the outcome of oxidative damage to biologically relevant macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. This occurs when oxidative stress-related molecules, generated in the extracellular environment or within the cell, exceed cellular antioxidant defenses. Major reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion, as well as 4-hydroxy- 2,3-nonenal (HNE) and related 4-hydroxy-2,3-alkenals (HAKs), major aldehydic end-products of lipid peroxidation, can act as potential mediators able to affect signal transduction pathways as well as the proliferative and functional response of target cells. H2O2 and superoxide anion may be also generated as molecular messengers within the cell as part of the cellular response to defined growth factors, cytokines and other mediators. The final consequence at tissue, cellular and molecular level is primarily affected by the steady state concentration of oxidative stress-related molecules. The main biological targets of free radicals are proteins, lipids and DNA.

Major consequences of reaction of ROS, HAKs and NO with biologically relevant macromolecules that can mediate pathophysiological effects:

ROS: DNA: oxidation, strand breaks, genotoxicity Proteins: oxidation, fragmentation, formation of carbonyls Lipids: lipid peroxidation and degradation

HAKs: DNA: adducts (low doses), strand breaks, genotoxicity (high doses) Proteins: adducts (Michael type reactions on Lys, Cys and His residues)

NO: DNA: oxidation, strand breaks Proteins: oxidation, nitrosation, nitration (nytrosylation of tyrosine) Lipids: lipid peroxidation and degradation

Continued oxidative stress can lead to chronic inflammation. Oxidative stress can activate a variety of transcription factors including NF-&kappa;B, AP-1, p53, HIF-1&alpha;, PPAR-&gamma;, &beta;-catenin/Wnt, and Nrf2. Activation of these transcription factors can lead to the expression of over 500 different genes, including those for growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can activate inflammatory pathways.

Glutathione (GSH) oxidation refers to the conversion of reduced glutathione to its oxidized form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in the presence of oxidative species. GSH plays an important role as an anti-oxidant in regulating cellular redox homeostasis, and is mainly present in the cell as the reduced form (98%). Deficiency in GSH or a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio results in decreased anti-oxidant function and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, thus making it a marker of cellular redox status. An imbalance in GSH/GSSG ratio has been implicated in the onset and progression of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, pulmonary diseases and cardiovascular diseases (Ballatori et al., 2009; Kalinina et al., 2014)"
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2090","Increase, Bone Remodeling","KE 2090","Bone remodeling is a lifelong process where mature bone tissue is removed by bone resorbing osteoclasts and new bone is formed by bone forming osteoblasts. Each local remodeling event involves a team called the basic multicellular unit (BMU) (Slyfield et al., 2012). Each BMU consists of several morphologically and functionally different cell types, mainly osteoblasts and osteoclasts, that act in coordination on the bone remodeling compartment to replace old bone by new bone.

Physiological bone remodeling, responsible for repairing damaged bone and for mineral homeostasis, is a highly coordinated process that requires balance between bone resorption and bone formation (Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). This tight regulation is necessary to maintain skeletal size, shape, and structural integrity (Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). Mechanical strain or stimulation of bone cells by hormones activates bone remodeling and causes the recruitment of osteoclast precursors, like hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), to the remodeling site to initiate resorption (Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). Osteocytes, mechanosensory cells that regulate bone homeostasis, basally produce transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&beta;) which inhibits osteoclastogenesis. TGF-&beta; levels are lowered following damage to the bone matrix through osteocyte apoptosis, removing this inhibitory signal (Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). Osteoblasts recruit osteoclast precursors to the remodeling site through the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Osteoblasts can then induce osteoclastogenesis through the increased expression of colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK-L), as well as the decreased expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), the inhibitor of RANK-L (Donaubauer et al., 2020; Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). Mature osteoclasts produce resorption pits also called resorption bays or Howship&rsquo;s lacunae (Slyfield et al., 2012). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secreted by osteoblasts degrade the osteoid lining the bone surface, exposing the bone for osteoclast attachment. A resorption cavity is formed as mature osteoclasts degrade the matrix (Raggatt and Partridge, 2010; Slyfield et al., 2012). The acidic environment produced by osteoclasts dissolves the mineralized matrix, while enzymes like Cathepsin K (CTSK) degrade the organic matrix. Reversal cells then remove the undigested demineralized collagen matrix to prepare for bone formation by osteoblasts. TGF-&beta; acts as the signal for the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Osteocytes also basally secrete sclerostin, which inhibits the Wnt pathway for osteoblastogenesis. Mechanical strain and parathyroid hormone (PTH) signaling contribute to suppression of sclerostin and subsequent osteoblastogenesis (Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). Mature osteoblasts create the osteoid (unmineralized) matrix with collagen and subsequently mineralize new bone tissue with hydroxyapatite, involving various enzymes including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (Donaubauer et al., 2020; Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). 

Disruption to this process results in an imbalance in the equilibrium of bone resorption and formation. For example,  increased resorption by stimulation of osteoclast activity can lead to excessive bone resorption and subsequent weakening of bone structure. The impairment of osteoblast function and survival osteoclasts and increased mineralization by osteoblasts will increase the rate of bone resorption and decrease can decrease the rate of bone formation.stimulation of osteoclast activity can lead to excessive bone resorption and subsequent weakening of bone structure. The impairment of osteoblast function and survival  can decrease the rate of bone formation.  These are measurable events."

Biological compartments: Recent studies have suggested that FSH stimulates the proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, inhibits apoptosis and facilitates neovascularisation (Tao et al. 2013). Earlier studies also have established that the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors are important prognostic indicators of breast and endometrial cancers, and epithelial ovarian cancer. Despite acceptance regarding the influence of reproductive hormones on ovarian cancer risk and considerable advances in the understanding of epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis on a molecular level, complete understanding of the biologic processes underlying malignant transformation of ovarian surface epithelium is still lacking  (Gharwan et al. 2015).

General role in biology: Malfunctioning of sex hormones (e.g., estradiol, estrone and progesterone) may result ovarian cancer (Fooladi et al. 2020, Meehan and Sadar 2003). Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the form of occupational usage of pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, plasticizers, cosmetics, etc. are the cause of ovarian cancer (Samtani et al. 2018). Clomiphene which is used as drug to treat infertility and it is reported that this chemical increases the risk of ovarian cancer (McLemore et al. 2009). Clomiphene (molecular initiating event, MIE) stimulates the releasing of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from hypothalamic. Also, it stimulates the secretion of the Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from pituitary (Cassidenti et al. 1992, Mungenast and Thalhammer 2014, Tomao et al. 2014). These hormones regulate the synthesis of sex hormons (e.g., estrogen) level (Shoemaker et al. 2010, Tomao et al. 2014). These sex hormones are primarily produced in the gonads through a series of enzyme-mediated reactions from cholesterol (precursor) and control through complex signalling pathway along hypothalamus &ndash; pituitary - gonadal (HPG) axis (Perkins et al. 2019, Shoemaker et al. 2010).  The series of complex signalling pathways in ovary include G-protein cycle, G-protein activation, adenylate cyclase (AC) activation, cyclic AMP (cAMP) activation, protein kinase A (PKA) activation, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) and StAR transcription. Ultimately, this signalling pathway activates the StAR protein which regulates the intake of cholesterol into the inner mitochondria where synthesis of sex hormones takes place. It may be noted that cholesterol is the precursor of the sex hormones synthesis.  Again, releasing of LH is regulated by estradiol and testosterone level resulting complex signalling pathway that includes genes, transcritome, proteome and metabolites (Perkins et al. 2019, Shoemaker et al. 2010). Under clomiphene exposure, synthesis of estrogen level becomes high resulting risk of ovarian cancer (McLemore et al. 2009, Tomao et al. 2014). Therefore, perturbations of GnRH, FSH and LH can result adverse phenotype as ovarian cancer."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2096","Occurrence, (Micro)vascular dysfunction","KE 2096","The description of this KE aims to facilitate incorporation of evidence for distinct but relevant molecular level events influencing  individual molecules and cells, but also important interactions driving higher (tissue/organ) organisational level events. 

The complexity of the current KE description is driven by: the level of biological organisation that it aims to cover, and the increasing availability and complexity of the measurement methods that aim to address it, also reflected in the evidence available for the converging KER2831. The challenges with complex KEs and their representations have been discussed (10.14573/altex.2112161, 10.1093/toxres/tfaa099).  Re-organisation into sub-KE may be possible as the data organisation and visualisation methods are enhanced in the AOP Wiki and also as evidence form new assays grows, providing greater resolution of the mechanistic aspects of microvascular dysfunction. 

Microvasculature (MV) is the tissue system/organ of vessels (capillaries, arterioles and venules), which enable delivery and exchange of gases (O2, CO2), nutrients, metabolites and circulating immune cells, within all organs of the body. Thus proper function of the MV is essential for adequate response to changes in metabolic demand and blood flow to the organs. 

Functional response of the microvasculature to normal physiologically changing or stressed tissue/organ environment is mediated by its specific cellular and molecular structure consisting of a variety of cell types intimately linked to the tissue environment. 

Exsosome-mediated communication between different cell types within the vasculature is increasingly recognised as key aspect of (mycro)vascular function, while interference/perturbations of this intercellular communication emerges as an important factor driving dysfunction and potential target for therapy [10.1186/s12964-022-00949-6; 10.1007/s12012-021-09700-y; 10.3389/fcvm.2022.912358; 10.3389/fcell.2019.00353; 10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165833].

Depending on the tissue/organ type there may be subtle molecular differences but the general cellular outline of the MV can be illustrated as in Figure 1 include:  

Endothelium:  inner lining monolayer of closely juxtaposed squamous endothelial cells (ECs). The quiescent or non-proliferating endothelium has an active role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by receiving and generating diverse biochemical (autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine) and mechanical signals (Ricard et al., 2021-10.1038/s41569-021-00517-4). 

One of the most commonly used surface markers for identification/sorting/enriching viable quiescent ECs is the CD31 in combination with the absence and/or presence of surface markers specific for other cells or for specific activation, dysfunction or differentiation state of the ECs (Goncharov 2017 - 10.1155/2017/9759735 Rakocevic 2017 - . 10.1016/j.yexmp.2017.02.005). A convenient list of specific endothelial cell markers and reagents for their identification can be found here together with some basic background information on each marker.

Dysregulated communication between ECs and other vascular cell types is associated with vascular dysfunction and pathological vascular remodelling in various pathological conditions (Rajendran et al., 2013 - 10.7150/ijbs.7502; M&eacute;ndez-Barbero et al., 2021- 10.3390/ijms22147284). Rajendran et al 2013 - 10.7150/ijbs.7502, provides a good comparison of healthy and dysfunctional vasculature based on the biochemical products of (mainly) ECs including: nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), uric acid, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), P-selectin. soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM.), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM), E-selectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;), interleukin-6 (IL-6). Under some stress conditions (e.g. infections, cell aging and damage) vascular dysfunction can be triggered by specific interaction of the vascular components and the innate immune surveillance complement system (10.1038/nrneph.2016.70; 10.1111/cei.12952; Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 5th edition; 10.2340/00015555761316). Dysfunction triggered by complement activation is particularly relevant for infectious stressors initiating adoptive immunity as part of its normal host response (e.g. viruses) [10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.045; 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01450].

Given the dynamic responses of ECs to environmental signals, including these from the intimately connected perivascular cells, test systems based on ECs require careful phenotypic characterisation.

ECs structure and function exhibit significant tissue specificity. Single&shy;cell RNA&shy;seq atlas of mouse endothelial cells isolated from different tissues by flow cytometry without the cell culture step, identified transcriptomic signatures of quiescent ECs and found that: arterial and venous endothelial cells from a specific tissue clustered together, showing that vascular endothelial cell heterogeneity comes mainly from tissue specificity rather than arterial, capillary or venous identity (Kalucka 2020 - 10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.015). Moreover, capillary endothelial cells that are involved in gas, ion, metabolite and hormone exchange between the blood and tissues have the highest heterogeneity among tissues (Kalucka 2020 - 10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.015). Similar results (i.e. tissue specificity) have been reported after re-analysis of independently generated single cells sequencing data Paik 2020 - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041433)

Comprehensive vasculature atlas from human tissues is not available but re-analysis of scRNAseq data from control human lung cohorts has been performed (Schupp 2021 - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.052318). The analysis identified that broad EC categories and conserved marker genes similar to those identified the mice data (Schupp 2021 - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.052318; Kalucka 2020 - 10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.015).

Intercellular communication of the endothelial with the other cells of the MV appears to be an important determinant of MV (dys)function (10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165833; 10.1007/s12012-021-09700-y; 10.1038/ncomms9024; 10.1038/s41598-018-34357-z; 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00765). EC derived exosomes contain some unique endothelial markers, including VE-cadherin, E-selectin, P-selectin, PECAM, ICAM-1, MCAM, endoglin, and ACE.  In addition, they also contain various miRNAs [10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165833; 10.3389/fmolb.2020.619697].. All of these molecules have biological functions in both normal endothelial physiology and pathogenesis.

Glicocalix, on the lumen side the MV, generated by the endothelium is composed of a negatively charged network of GAGs and proteoglycans. It modulates interactions between the vasuclature wall and blood cell. Glicocalix  represents a binding site for crucial anticoagulant mediators such as heparin cofactor II, antithrombin III, thrombomodulin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). [Yilmaz 2019 - 10.1093/ckj/sfz042], 

Basement membrane represents the layer of complex extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (20&ndash;200&thinsp;nm) on the tissue side the endothelium. It provides a mechanical support and divide tissues into compartments, but also influence cellular behaviour Vascular basement membrane is a three-dimensional network of proteins from four major glycoprotein families: laminins, collagen IV isoforms, nidogens, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). Additionally, many other proteins are differentially expressed in the vascular basement membrane depending on the developmental and physiological state of the vasculature. These include insoluble fibronectin, fibulin 1 and 2, collagen type XVIII, thrombospondins 1, and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) (Thomsen 2017 - 10.1177/0271678X17722436, and references therein). The ECM is generated by ECs and pericytes (Thomsen 2017 - 10.1177/0271678X17722436, and references therein).

Pericytes are perivascular, mural cells that have intimate contact with the endothelial cells and together support important functions such as maintaining the physical and functional integrity of the Blood Brain Barer (BBB), regulating capillary diameter, cerebral blood flow and maintaining extracellular matrix protein levels. Their identity, ontogeny, and progeny is not characterised as well as that of endothelial cells. They express multiple markers and their origin differs by tissue, which makes their identification and understanding of their function difficult (Armulik 2011 - 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.07.001).

A recent scRNAsec analysis of microfluidic droplets of mouse tissues confirm that two previously known perycite and conserved markers (Cspg4 or Pdgfrb) are co-expressed in the mural cell clusterdefined as perycites from lung, heart, kidney, and bladder (Beek 2022 -10.3389/fcvm.2022.876591). Other potential tissue specific markers were also identified in this study.

Pericytes also have the potential to give rise to different tissues in vitro but this is not clear in vivo. (Yamazaki 2018 - 10.3389/fcvm.2018.00078). 

Vascular smooth muscle cells  [VSMC] surround the endothelium, pericytes and basal membrane in larger vessels. They contain contractile filaments and maintain vascular tone in response to (endocrine?, paracrine? autocrine?) action of vasoactive mediators and neurotransmitters (e.g. Angiotenisn II, Angiotensin 1-7, Endothelins, NO, epinephrine and norepinephrine) via their receptors or effectors e.g AGTR1, MasR, endothein receptor A and B or guanylate cyclase, and adrenoceptors, respectively.

Under different stress condition (persistant stretch, injury, inflammatory cytokines and excess oxidized lipids) and also during normal development, VSMC can undergo phenotypic switching or remodelling from a contractile to synthetic or proliferative phenotype wich involves a partial down regulation of the proteins that activate the contractile apparatus in favour of the synthetic and proliferative cellular machinery [10.5772/intechopen.77115; 10.1152/physrev.00041.2003]. 

Proliferative smooth muscle cells have an attenuated response to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, probably due to the down regulation of the contractile apparatus and certain elements of the subcellular signalling machinery that is involved in vasoconstriction. Notably, many of the vasoactive modulators (e.g. angiotensin II endothelin and noradrenaline) also function to promote smooth muscle proliferation. Chronically elevated levels platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), for example, generated from unstable thrombus, can also contribute to proliferative vascular disorders. On the other hand, nitric oxide, limits smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy. ACE2, Angotenisn 1-7 and Mas receptor also appear to play important role in the modulation of the prliferative phenotypic switching of VSMC [10.1155/2012/121740; 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03388; 10.1042/BSR20192012; 10.26355/eurrev_202004_20867].

Similar to the endothelial cells, VSMCs produce exosomes containing components of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) such as collagens, proteoglycans, hyaluronan and laminin as well as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (TIMPs) which are particularly important for repair and remodelling of growing or damaged vessels. miRNAs released from VSMC also , are increasingly recognised as intercellular signalling molecules important for MV (dys)function [10.1186/s12964-022-00949-6; 10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.03.031]

MV is a dynamic organ and proper cellular differentiation, renewal and intercellular interactions mediated by various signalling molecules govern its functional and structural integrity. These interactions also govern the return to homeostasis under some stress conditions, restoring basal structure/function of the vasculature and ultimately well oxygenated tissue/organ. 

In addition to the markers for specific MV cell lineage, other more ubiquitously expressed proteins (such as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 &ndash; ACE2) may, under some circumstances, represent markers for differentiation state or (dys)function of the MV at cellular or tissue level. For example, ACE2 expression in HBMEC &amp; HUVEC perfusion culture is stimulated by flow (HBMEC &lt; HUVEC) (qRT-PCR); also it is increased by flow intensity and vessel shape in the MCA 3D model of stenosis (immunostaining cells) [10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.032764]. Given that ACE2 is implicated as the main receptor for viral entry of SARS-CoV2 associated with COVID19 disease, the level and the dynamics of ACE2 expression is likely to be important for driving COVID19-associated vascular dysfunctions. Notably, in mature human tissues, ACE2 is not expressed at significant levels in the vascular compared to other cells evaluated (Human Protein Atlas version 22.0). Within the human vascular tissue it appears that expression in smooth muscle cells is significantly higher than that in endothelial cells and comparable to that in fibroblasts (Human Protein Atlas version 22 &ndash; single cell type-vascular). Pericytes are not specifically identified in this project.

Excessive disruption of the structural integrity of the MV or interference with the normal balanced function of molecular mediators leads to inability of the MV to maintain homeostasis i.e. (micro)vascular  dysfunction."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2097","Increase, Pro-Inflammatory Mediators","KE 2097","(Adapted from KE 1493 - in blue)

Inflammatory mediators are soluble, diffusible molecules that act locally at the site of tissue damage and infection, and at more distant sites. They can be divided into exogenous and endogenous mediators. 

Exogenous mediators of inflammation are bacterial products or toxins like endotoxin or lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Endogenous mediators of inflammation are produced from within the (innate and adaptive) immune system itself, as well as other systems. They can be derived from molecules that are normally present in the plasma in an inactive form, such as peptide fragments of some components of complement, coagulation, and kinin systems. Or they can be released at the site of injury by a number of cell types that either contain them as preformed molecules within storage granules, e.g. histamine, or which can rapidly switch on the machinery required to synthesize the mediators. 

Pro-inflammatory mediators can have dual properties of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects, dysregulation of the balance can lead to chronic inflammation which is implicated in many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases or cancer

Examples of pro-inflammatory mediators are provided below in Table 1.

The increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators can have negative consequences on the parenchymal cells leading even to cell death, as described for TNF-a or peroxynitrite on neurons (Brown and Bal-Price, 2003). Along with TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta; and IL-6 have been shown to exhibit negative consequences on neurogenesis and neuronal precursor cell proliferation when overexpressed. IFN-&gamma;  is also associated with neuronal damage, although it is not as extensively studied compared to TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta; and IL-6. These cytokines are normally involved in brain homeostasis and maintaining tissue repair following an injury, although it can have negative consequences (Fan &amp; Pang, 2017). In addition, via a feedback loop, they can act on the reactive resident cells thus maintaining or exacerbating their reactive state; and by modifying elements of their signalling pathways, they can favour the M1 phenotypic polarization and the chronicity of the inflammatory process (Taetzsch et al., 2015).  

Studies show that the dysregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators can influence both cancer and non-cancer outcomes. Excessive/persistent pro-inflammatory signaling due to injury or exposure to chronic exposures can create an environment conducive to cellular transformation, proliferation. In autoimmune diseases, aberrant immune responses driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-&alpha; lead to chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease, involve dysregulated pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-1&beta; and TNF-&alpha;, contributing to neuronal degeneration. Basically, this event occurs equally in various tissues and does not require tissue-specific descriptions. Nevertheless, there are some specificities such as the release of glutamate by brain reactive glial cells (Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Vesce et al., 2007). The differences may rather reside in the type of insult favouring the increased expression and/or release of a specific class of inflammatory mediators, as well the time after the insult reflecting different stages of the inflammatory process. For these reasons, the analyses of the changes of a battery of inflammatory mediators rather than of a single one is a more adequate measurement of this KE."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2117","Increase, goblet cell number","KE 2117","Goblet cell is a mucus secreting cell type that can be found in epithelial mucosa of the intestine, lung, and eye. Goblet cells are necessary for mucosal epithelial homeostasis as well as for the appropriate function of both innate and adaptive immunity. Alterations in goblet cell numbers are characteristics of some pathologies. In the airway, the increased number of goblet cells is generally associated with diseases, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While some disorders of the intestine and conjunctiva are associated with the decrease in goblet cell numbers, Crohn&rsquo;s disease, cystic fibrosis, allergic conjunctivitis, and inverted mucoepidermoid papilloma have increased number of goblet cells (McCauley &amp; Guasch, 2015). Goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) can arise following airway injury and is defined by otherwise intact epithelium with an increase in the number of goblet cells (Hao et al, 2012; SAETTA et al, 2000). Pathologists define goblet cell metaplasia as apparent loss of ciliated or club cells with an increase of goblet cells, without an apparent increase in the total number of epithelial cells (Lumsden et al, 1984; Reader et al, 2003; Shimizu et al, 1996). The increased number of goblet cells via proliferation has been demonstrated in the rat intestine (Hino et al, 2012) and eye (Gu et al, 2008; Li et al, 2013; Shatos et al, 2008) in response dietary fiber and EGFR stimulation, respectively. 

Evidence for Perturbation by Stressor 

Several studies have shown that the number of goblet cells increase in response to various stressors. Cigarette smoke exposure resulted in the increase in the number of goblet cells in the airway of rats (Kato et al, 2020; Xiao et al, 2011), mice (Mebratu et al, 2011; Yang et al, 2020), dogs (Park et al, 1977), monkeys (Manevski et al, 2022), and in human airway epithelial cells cultured in air-liquid interface (Haswell et al, 2010; Haswell et al, 2021). Similarly, exposure of mice or rats to nebulized acrolein resulted in goblet cell metaplasia in the airways (Chen et al, 2010; Liu et al, 2009; Wang et al, 2009) and the treatment of primary human bronchial epithelial cells differentiated at the air-liquid interface with up to 1 &micro;M acrolein induced a concentration dependent increase in the percentage of MUC5A-positive cells (Haswell et al., 2010). Ozone has also been shown to contribute to the increased number of goblet cells in the airways of mice (Jang et al, 2006; Larsen et al, 2010) and rats (Wagner et al, 2003). The goblet cell numbers also increased in the intestine of rats infected with Hymenolepis diminuta (tapeworm) (Webb et al, 2007) and mice infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (hookworm) (Turner et al, 2013). Finally, air pollution was shown to trigger GCH in the eye (Novaes et al, 2007)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2118","Succinate dehydrogenase, inhibited","KE 2118","Eukaryotic succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, EC1.3.5.1 (Brenda, IntEnz)) is an enzyme complex comprising four polypeptide chains (SDHA - SDHD) with associated FAD,  Fe-S and haem prosthetic groups that catalyses the reversible oxidation (dehydrogenation) of succinate to fumarate with concomitant reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol, serving to channel reducing equivalents from succinate, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate, to ubiquinol, an intermediate of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain (Du et al, 2023).

The overall reaction:

succinate + ubiquinone = fumarate + ubiquinol

comprises two, reversible half-reactions:

(1) succinate + FAD = fumarate + FADH2

and:

(2) FADH2 + ubiquinone = FAD + ubiquinol

each of which is catalysed at a different active site.

The active site of reaction 1 is in the hydrophilic protein SDHA that contains the covalently bound FAD group, and protudes from the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) into the mitochondrial matrix, making it available to exchange succinate and fumarate within the TCA cycle. The active site of reaction 2 is in a more hydrophobic region comprising transmembrane domains of proteins SDHC and SCHD that insert complex II into the IMM (Du et al, 2023), making it available to ubiquinol and ubiquinone shuttling within the IMM.

The presence of two distinct and different active sites enables SDH inibition to be effected in at least two ways: by inhibition of either active site, with potentially different biochemical and physiological consequences, and by inhibitors with differing characteristics.

Inhibition of SDH can result in reduction of mitochondrial electron transport, and subsequent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. Chen et al, 2021), and also generation of superoxide in the mitochondria, leading to with subsequently deleterious effects such as initiation of apoptosis or necrosis (Murphy et al, 2009)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2119","Insulin resistance, increased","KE 2119","Under normal physiological conditions, an increase in plasma glucose, for instance in the post-prandial phase, leads to increased insulin secretion by the pancreas, and consequent increase in plasma insulin concentration. The insulin increases glucose uptake into peripheral tissues, and inhibits hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In times of stress, the insulin response can be inhibited by stress hormones and proinhibitory cytokines, a mechanism known as insulin resistance (IR), that serves to maintain blood glucose levels during stress response (Tsatsoulis et al, 2013). Inappropriate stress hormone and cytokine generation can lead to individuals showing inappropriate insulin resistance, manifested as lack of insulin-stimulation of glucose uptake into adipose and muscle, and lack of insulin suppression of hepatic glucose release. 

IR is associated with multiple health conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, metabolism associated fatty liver disease and polycystic ovary syndrome. It is a complex metabolic disorder, the exact causes of which are still to be fully resolved (Li et al, 2022). The mechanism by which IR manifests itself is primarily by abnormalities in insulin signal transduction (Pei et al, 2022)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2146","Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2","KE 2146","ERK1 and ERK2 are proteins of 43 and 41 kDa that are nearly 85% identical overall, with much greater identity in the core regions involved in binding substrates (Boulton et al., 1990; 1991). The two phosphoacceptor sites, tyrosine and threonine, which are phosphorylated to activate the kinases, are separated by a glutamate residue in both ERK1 and ERK2 to give the motif TEY in the activation loop (Payne et al., 1991). Both are ubiquitously expressed, although their relative abundance in tissues is variable. For example, in many immune cells ERK2 is the predominant species, while in several cells of neuroendocrine origin they may be equally expressed (Gray Pearson and others 2001). They are stimulated to some extent by a vast number of ligands and cellular perturbations, with some cell type specificity (Lewis et al., 1998). In fibroblasts (the cell type in which the generalizations about their behavior and functions have been developed) they are activated by serum, growth factors, cytokines, certain stresses, ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and transforming agents, to name a few (Gray Pearson and others 2001). They are highly expressed in postmitotic neurons and other highly differentiated cells (Boulton et al., 1991). In these cells they are often involved in adaptive responses such as long-term potentiation (English and Sweatt 1996; Atkins et al., 1998; Rossi-Arnaud et al., 1997)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2158","Influenza A Virus (IAV) binds sialic acid glycan receptor","KE 2158","Sialic acid was one of the first viral receptors identified5. Humans have 6 sialyl transferases that catalyze the addition of Sia with an a2,3 linkage to terminal galactose residues and 2 that catalyze the addition of an a2,6 linkage to terminal galactose residues6.

 

The HA receptor of the IAV attaches to the surface of the host cell via glycoconjugates that contain terminal sialic acid residues. The virus then &ldquo;scans&rdquo; the surface of the cell for the correct receptor, using its NA to remove nonproductive HA associations. The exact receptor is currently unknown however human influenza viruses preferentially bind sialic acid linked to galactose by a2,6 linkage, while avian influenza viruses prefer a2,3 linkages1. However, most viruses are not this dichotomous and the ability to bind sialic acid is more of a spectrum2. Additionally, the human respiratory tract contains both types of linkages as a gradient, with more a2,6 linked sialic acids present in the upper airway transitioning to more a2,3 linked sialic acids in the lower airway3. Some avian viruses can only replicate effectively in cells that express a2,3 linked sialic acids, which in humans is limited to the lower respiratory tract, which may serve as barrier to interspecies transmission and require that successful zoonosis is contingent upon the ability of the virus to bind a2,6 linked sialic acids, making this a marker of pandemic potential3. However, this is complicated by new evidence that non-binding sialic acids can contribute to enhanced binding and infection through hetero-multivalent interactions4. Individual hemagglutinin (HA) interactions with sialic acid glycan receptors are low affinity (KD ~0,5 to 20mM) leading to a low initial binding rate but high avidity is achieved through multivalent interactions with a receptor coated surface4.

 

Recent findings suggest phosphor-glycans are a potential alternative IAV receptor7. Additionally, two subtypes of IAV found exclusively in South and Central American bats (H17N10 and H18N11) use MHC class II for entry7,8."

The virus is then trafficked to the endosome, where the change in pH activates the M2 ion channel protein of the virus, leading to a conformational change in the HA exposing the fusion peptide and causing subsequent fusion of the viral envelope with the membrane of the vesicle (1). Following fusion, the vRNPs are released into the cytoplasm in a process known as &ldquo;uncoating&rdquo; and trafficked to the nucleus (1). This entire process takes about 10 minutes (5)"
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2180","Immune mechanisms antagonized by viral proteins","KE 2180","IAV infection is detected by multiple host sensors. Within the infected cell, viral RNA in the cytosol (potentially as part of a stress granule) is recognized by RIG-I which signals through MAVS to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 IFN (1). Additionally, while toll-like receptor (TLR) expression is usually localized to immune cells, nasal epithelial cells also express a majority of TLR subtypes (2). This allows for recognition of IAV through TLR3 or TLR7(1). Sensing of dsRNA through TLR3 and TRIF intermediate leads to a signaling cascade via NFkB and IRF3 to induce expression of Type I IFNs and ISGs as well as IL-1B and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (1). This is despite the fact that IAV does not produce dsRNA, however due to interactions with UAP56, TLR3 is able to recognize different RNA structures (5). Sensing ssRNA through TLR7 and Myd88 intermediate leads to a signaling cascade involving NFkB and IRF7 to also induce expression of Type I IFNs and ISGs as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (1). 

The IAV NS1 protein binds to CPSF30 blocking the cleavage of pre-mRNAs and recruitment of the poly(A) polymerase and is considered the key antagonizing factor (3,4). This causes accumulation of unprocessed cellular pre-mRNA accumulation in the nucleus leading to the inhibition of general gene expression as well as induction of IFN, ISGs, and other pro-inflammatory gene (3). Additionally, NS1 can bind cellular dsDNA as well as components of mRNA export machinery, again preventing the expression of antiviral genes (3).Additionally, the IAV PA-X protein also blocks cellular antiviral responses by selectively degrading host RNA Pol II transcribed RNAs in the nucleus, sparing Pol I and Pol III products (3). This again inhibits expression of antiviral and proinflammatory genes."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2192","Influenza A Virus production increased","KE 2192","The major stages of Influenza A virus (IAV) replication, which could each be multiple KE&#39;s on their own but are summarized here, include trafficking to the host cell nucleus, replication of vRNAs, viral mRNA transcription, assembly and trafficking of vRNPs, ER targeting and maturation, and HA proteolytic activation at the Golgi or Plasma membrane (1). 

The current model of IAV replication is vRNP entry into the nucleus via the importin-alpha-importin-beta nuclear import pathway within one hour (1-9). However, this step has been shown to contribute to host restriction so it is worth noting that a majority of this work has been performed in immortalized cell lines from various species (1).

Replication of vRNAs occurs in two steps- transcription of the reverse complement (cRNA) followed by transcription of new genome copies using the cRNAs as templates- in the nucleus facilitated by the heterotrimeric viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (1). The transcription process is unprimed and reliant on 13 conserved nucleotides at the 5&rsquo; end and 12 nucleotides at the 3&rsquo; end of each segment that are partially complementary and form a double-stranded &ldquo;promoter&rdquo; by base-pairing (10). This &ldquo;promoter&rdquo; is recognized by the viral RNA polymerase and the template is transcribed. 

Viral mRNA transcription, in contrast, is primed by a process known as &ldquo;cap- snatching&rdquo; from host mRNAs (11,12) and polyadenylated through stuttering (13,14). Two segments- M and NS- are spliced (15). NS transcripts have a balanced ratio of spliced to un spliced throughout infection but the ratio of spliced M (M2) increases through infection, although the efficiency differs between strains and also functions in host restriction (16-19). 

Following nuclear export, translation of the viral mRNAs is divided between cytosolic ribosomes (internal proteins PB1, PB2, PA, NP, NS1, NS2, and M1) and ER- associated ribosomes (membrane proteins- HA, NA, and M2) (1). The NP and polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, PA) traffic back to the nucleus to assist in viral mRNA transcription and vRNA replication (1) while NS1 is also trafficked to the nucleus to inhibit interferon signaling (see KE 2180). vRNPs are trafficked to the plasma membrane to meet the other proteins for viral assembly by Rab11, which associates with Pb2 to ensure that all new virions incorporated vRNPs carrying a polymerase (20). 

During translocation within the ER, the N-terminus of HA and M2 is directly translocated into the ER lumen, while the NA C-terminus is positioned in the ER lumen (1). Both HA and NA receive multiple N-linked glycans which have been shown to affect activity and antigenicity but mainly function in folding efficiency (21-24). The HA protein is formed through trimerization of independently folded monomers while the NA tetramer results from association of co-translationally formed dimers (21,25,26,27). An abundance of HA and NA is produced during infection to promote oligomerization but consequences of this approach include triggering of the ER stress response, which must be blocked, and syncytia formation, which promotes cell to cell transmission (1,28,29,30)

The HA surface protein is synthesized as an inactive form denoted HA0 (1, 31, 32, 33). HA0 is then proteolytically activated through cleavage into HA1 and HA2 active subunits by trypsin-like proteases (1,31,32,33,34). IAV is fairly promiscuous in its use of these proteases, and the cleavage occurs in a multi- or mono- basic site on the HA0 protein (34,35). Highly pathogenic avian IAVs tend to have a multibasic cleavage site that is targeted by furin (36). Human and low pathogenic avian viruses tend to contain a monobasic cleavage site and utilize any available protease such as TMRPSS2, TMPRSS4, and HAT for proteolytic activation (37,38)."

The M2 protein has also been shown to contribute to membrane bending and scission (8). After budding, release is mediated by the sialidase property of NA. The NA protein catalyzes the hydrolysis of all sialic acid attachments made by the HA protein allowing for the virus to be released from the cell membrane (1,9,10)."

The Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptor &gamma; (PPAR&gamma;) belongs to Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptors (PPARs; NR1C) steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of transcription factors, which respond to specific ligands by altering gene expression in a cell-specific manner. The PPAR&gamma; gene contains three promoters that yield three isoforms, namely, PPAR-&gamma;1, 2 and 3. PPAR-&gamma;1 and &gamma;3 RNA transcripts translate into the identical PPAR-&gamma;1 protein.

Biological compartments

PPAR&gamma; is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, promoting adipocyte differentiation, but is also present in various cells and tissues, for review see (Braissant et al. 1996). PPAR&gamma; expression is tissue dependent (L Fajas et al. 1997), (Lluis Fajas, Fruchart, and Auwerx 1998). PPAR&gamma; is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue, where it is a master regulator of adipogenesis as well as a potent modulator of whole-body lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Evans, Barish, and Wang 2004), (Tontonoz and Spiegelman 2008). Whereas PPAR&gamma;1 is expressed in many tissues, the expression of PPAR&gamma;2 is restricted to adipose tissue under physiological conditions but can be induced in other tissues by a high-fat diet (Saraf et al. 2012).

General role in biology

PPAR&gamma; is activated after the binding of natural ligands such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostaglandin metabolites. It can also be activated by synthetic ligands such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or troglitazone) (Lehmann et al., 1995). PPAR&gamma; controls many vital processes such as glucose metabolism and inflammation as well as variety of developmental programs(Wahli &amp; Desvergne, 1999), (Rotman et al., 2008), (Wahli &amp; Michalik, 2012). This receptor itself is essential for developmental processes since targeted disruption of this gene results in embryo lethality, due in part to defective placental development, therefore modulation of PPAR&gamma; activity may impact endocrine regulated processes during development as well as later in life."

This particular key event specifically refers to interaction with nuclear AR.  Downstream KE responses to activation of membrane ARs may be different.

Responses at the macromolecular level: Binding of a ligand, including xenobiotics that act as AR agonists, to the cytosolic AR mediates a conformational shift that facilitates dissociation from accompanying heat shock proteins and dimerization with another AR (Prescott and Coetzee 2006; Claessens et al. 2008; Centenera et al. 2008). Homodimerization unveils a nuclear localization sequence, allowing the AR-ligand complex to translocate to the nucleus and bind to androgen-response elements (AREs) (Claessens et al. 2008; Cutress et al. 2008). This elicits recruitment of additional transcription factors and transcriptional activation of androgen-responsive genes (Heemers and Tindall 2007).

AR paralogs:


	Most vertebrates have a single gene coding for nuclear AR. However, most fish have two AR genes (AR-A, AR-B) as a result of a whole genome duplication event after the split of Acipenseriformes from teleosts but before the divergence of Osteoglossiformes (Douard et al. 2008).
	AR-B has been lost in Cypriniformes, Siluriformes, Characiformes, and Salmoniformes (Douard et al. 2008).
	In Percomorphs, AR-B has accumulated significant substitutions in the both ligand binding and DNA binding domains (Douard et al. 2008).

The AR is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family (Davey &amp; Grossmann, 2016). The AR has three domains: the N-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain, with the latter being most evolutionary conserved. Testosterone (T) and the more biologically active dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are endogenous ligands for the AR (MacLean et al, 1993; MacLeod et al, 2010; Schwartz et al, 2019). In teleost fishes, 11-ketotestosterone is the second main ligand (Schuppe et al, 2020). Human AR mutations and mouse knock-out models have established a pivotal role for the AR in masculinization and spermatogenesis (Walters et al, 2010). Apart from the essential role for AR in male reproductive development and function (Walters et al, 2010), the AR is also expressed in many other tissues and organs such as bone, muscles, ovaries, and the immune system (Rana et al, 2014). 

AR antagonism as Key Event

The main function of the AR is to activate gene transcription in cells. Canonical signaling occurs by ligands (androgens) binding to AR in the cytoplasm which results in translocation to the cell nucleus, receptor dimerization and binding to specific regulatory DNA sequences (Heemers &amp; Tindall, 2007). The gene targets regulated by AR activation depends on cell/tissue type and what stage of development activation occur, and is, for instance, dependent on available co-factors. Apart from the canonical signaling pathway, AR can also initiate cytoplasmic signaling pathways with other functions than the nuclear pathway, for instance rapid change in cell function by ion transport changes (Heinlein &amp; Chang, 2002) and association with Src kinase to activate MAPK/ERK signaling and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Leung &amp; Sadar, 2017)."

This finding is demonstrated from the absence of triglyceride accumulation on SREBP-1c (-/-) mice [1], [2], [3], [4].
However there is evidence that this effect is not induced in the embryonic state indicating a different role of the SREBP-1c between embryonic and adult life [5]. It is also suggested that for lipogenic genes, SREBP-1c acts together with ChREBP [6]. In addition, in STZ diabetic mice, adenovirus-mediated over-expression of SREBP-1c in the liver resulted in an increase of lipogenic enzyme expression with an increase of the triglyceride hepatic content and a marked decrease in the hyperglycaemia of diabetic mice mimicking perfectly the effect of an insulin injection [7].

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/265","Activation, Stellate cells","KE 265","Stellate cell activation means a transdifferentiation from a quiescent vitamin A&ndash;storing cell to a proliferative and contractile myofibroblast. Multiple cells and cytokines play a part in the regulation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation that consists of discrete phenotype responses, mainly proliferation, contractility, fibrogenesis, matrix degradation, chemotaxis, and retinoid loss.

HSCs undergo activation through a two-phase process. The first step, the initiation phase, is triggered by injured hepatocytes, reactive oxygen speecies (ROS) and paracrine stimulation from neighbouring cell types (Kupffer cells (KCs), Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and platelets) and make HSCs sensitized to activation by up-regulating various receptors. The perpetuation phase refers to the maintenance of HSC activation, which is a dynamic process including the secretion of autocrine and paracrine growth factors (such as TGF-&beta;1), chemokines, and the up-regulation of collagen synthesis (mainly type I collagen). In response to growth factors (including Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)) HSCs proliferate. Increased contractility (Endothelin-1 and NO are the key opposing counter-regulators that control HSC contractility, in addition to angiotensinogen II, and others) leads to increased portal resistance. Driven by chemoattractants their accumulation in areas of injury is enhanced. TGF-&beta;1 synthesis promotes activation of neighbouring quiescent hepatic stellate cells, whereas the release of HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) stimulates regeneration of adjacent hepatocytes. The release of chemoattractants (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1) and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)) amplifies inflammation (Lee and Friedman; 2011; Friedman, 2010; 2008; 2000; Bataller and Brenner, 2005; &uarr; Lotersztain et al., 2005; Poli, 2000). Activated HSCs (myofibroblasts) are the primary collagen producing cell, the key cellular mediators of fibrosis and a nexus for converging inflammatory pathways leading to fibrosis. Experimental inhibition of stellate cell activation prevents fibrosis (Li, Jing-Ting et al.,2008; George et al. (1999)."

General role in biology
StAR is required for cholesterol shuttling across the mitochondrial membrane and appears to regulate acute steroid production (Clark and Stocco, 1997). Transcriptional or translational inhibition of StAR expression results in a dramatic decrease in steroid biosynthesis, whereas ~10–15% of steroid synthesis appears to be mediated through StAR-independent mechanisms (Manna et al. 2001) (Clark and Stocco, 1997).
In contrast, chronically regulated steroid production appears to be largely mediated by increased transcription of steroidogenic enzymes (Hum and Miller 1993)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/277","Thyroid hormone synthesis, Decreased","KE 277","The thyroid hormones (TH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are thyrosine-based hormones. Synthesis of THs is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) binding to its receptor and thyroidal availability of iodine via the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Other proteins contributing to TH production in the thyroid gland, including thyroperoxidase (TPO), dual oxidase enzymes (DUOX), and the transport protein pendrin are also necessary for iodothyronine production (Zoeller et al., 2007).

The production of THs in the thyroid gland and resulting serum concentrations are controlled by a negatively regulated feedback mechanism. Decreased T4 and T3 serum concentrations activates the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis which upregulates thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) that acts to increase production of additional THs (Zoeller and Tan, 2007). This regulatory system includes: 1) the hypothalamic secretion of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH); 2) the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary; 3) hormonal transport by the plasma binding proteins; 4) cellular uptake mechanisms at the tissue level; 5) intracellular control of TH concentrations by deiodinating mechanisms; 6) transcriptional function of the nuclear TH receptor; and 7) in the fetus, the transplacental passage of T4 and T3 (Zoeller et al., 2007).

TRH and the TSH primarily regulate the production of T4, often considered a &ldquo;pro-hormone,&rdquo; and to a lesser extent of T3, the transcriptionally active TH. Most of the hormone released from the thyroid gland into circulation is in the form of T4, while peripheral deiodination of T4 is responsible for the majority of circulating T3. Outer ring deiodination of T4 to T3 is catalyzed by the deiodinases 1 and 2 (DIO1 and DIO2), with DIO1 expressed mainly in liver and kidney, and DIO2 expressed in several tissues including the brain (Bianco et al., 2006). Conversion of T4 to T3 takes place mainly in the liver and kidney, but also in other target organs such as in the brain, the anterior pituitary, brown adipose tissue, thyroid and skeletal muscle (Gereben et al., 2008; Larsen, 2009). 

In mammals, most evidence for the ontogeny of TH synthesis comes from measurements of serum hormone concentrations. And, importantly, the impact of xenobiotics on fetal hormones must include the influence of the maternal compartment since a majority of fetal THs are derived from maternal blood early in fetal life, with a transition during mid-late gestation to fetal production of THs that is still supplemented by maternal THs. In humans, THs can be found in the fetus as early as gestational weeks 10-12, and concentations rise continuously until birth. At term, fetal T4 is similar to maternal levels, but T3 remains 2-3 fold lower than maternal levels. In rats, THs can be detected in the fetus as early as the second gestational week, but fetal synthesis does not start until gestational day 17 with birth at gestational day 22-23. Maternal THs continue to supplement fetal production until parturition. (see Howdeshell, 2002; Santisteban and Bernal, 2005 for review). Due to the maternal factor, the life stage specific impact of TPO inhibition after exposure to environmental chemicals is complex (Ramhoj et al., 2022).

Decreased TH synthesis in the thyroid gland may result from several possible molecular-initiating events (MIEs) including: 1) Disruption of key catalytic enzymes or cofactors needed for TH synthesis, including TPO, NIS, or dietary iodine insufficiency. Theoretically, decreased synthesis of Tg could also affect TH production (Kessler et al., 2008; Yi et al., 1997). Mutations in genes that encode requisite proteins in the thyroid may also lead to impaired TH synthesis, including mutations in pendrin associated with Pendred Syndrome (Dossena et al., 2011), mutations in TPO and Tg (Huang and Jap 2015), and mutations in NIS (Spitzweg and Morris, 2010). 2) Decreased TH synthesis in cases of clinical hypothyroidism may be due to Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis or other forms of thyroiditis, or physical destruction of the thyroid gland as in radioablation or surgical treatment of thyroid lymphoma. 3) It is possible that TH synthesis may also be reduced subsequent to disruption of the negative feedback mechanism governing TH homeostasis, e.g. pituitary gland dysfunction may result in a decreased TSH signal with concomitant T3 and T4 decreases. 4) More rarely, hypothalamic dysfunction can result in decreased TH synthesis. 

Increased fetal TH levels are also possible. Maternal Graves disease, which results in fetal thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism and increased serum T4 levels), has been successfully treated by maternal administration of TPO inhibitors (c.f., Sato et al., 2014).  

It should be noted that different species and different life stages store different amounts of TH precursors and iodine within the thyroid gland. Thus, decreased TH synthesis via transient iodine insufficiency or inhibition of TPO may not affect TH release from the thyroid gland until depletion of stored iodinated Tg. Adult humans may store sufficient Tg-DIT residues to serve for several months to a year of TH demand (Greer et al., 2002; Zoeller, 2004). Neonates and infants have a much more limited supply of less than a week.

While the TH system is highly conserved across vertebrates, there are some taxon-specific considerations.

Zebrafish and fathead minnows are oviparous fish species in which maternal THs are transferred to the eggs and regulate early embryonic developmental processes during external (versus intra-uterine in mammals) development (Power et al., 2001; Campinho et al., 2014; Ruuskanen and Hsu, 2018) until embryonic TH synthesis is initiated. Maternal transfer of THs to the eggs has been demonstrated in zebrafish (Walpita et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2012) and fathead minnows (Crane et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2016).

Decreases in TH synthesis can only occur after initiation of embryonic TH synthesis. The components of the TH system responsible for TH synthesis are highly conserved across vertebrates and therefore interference with the same molecular targets compared to mammals can lead to decreased TH synthesis (TPO, NIS, etc.) in fish. Endogenous transcription profiles of thyroid-related genes in zebrafish and fathead minnow showed that mRNA coding for these genes is also maternally transferred and increasing expression of most transcripts during hatching and embryo-larval transition indicates a fully functional HPT axis in larvae (Vergauwen et al., 2018). Although the HPT axis is highly conserved, there are some differences between fish and mammals (Blanton and Specker, 2007; Deal and Volkoff, 2020). For example, in fish, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) often plays a more important role in regulating thyrotropin (TSH) secretion by the pituitary and thus TH synthesis compared to TSH-releasing hormone (TRH). Also, in most fish species thyroid follicles are more diffusely located in the pharyngeal region rather than encapsulated in a gland."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/279","Thyroperoxidase, Inhibition","KE 279","Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is a heme-containing apical membrane protein within the follicular lumen of thyrocytes that acts as the enzymatic catalyst for thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis. TPO catalyzes several reactions in the thyroid gland, including: the oxidation of iodide; nonspecific iodination of tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin (Tg); and the coupling of iodotyrosyls to produce Tg-bound monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT) (Divi et al., 1997; Kessler et al., 2008; Ruf et al., 2006; Taurog et al., 1996). The outcome of TPO inhibition is decreased synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), a decrease in release of these hormones from the gland into circulation, and unless compensated, a consequent decrease in systemic concentrations of T4, and possibly T3. The primary product of TPO-catalyzed TH synthesis is T4 (Taurog et al., 1996; Zoeller et al., 2007) that would be peripherally or centrally deiodinated to T3.

It is important to note that TPO is a complex enzyme that has two catalytic cycles and is capable of iodinating multiple species (Divi et al., 1997). Alterations in all of these events are not covered by some of the commonly used assays that measure &ldquo;TPO inhibition&rdquo; (e.g., guaiacol and AmplexUltraRed, see below). Ususally just the first step of this series of events is covered by assays that measure TPO inhibition. Therefore, in the context of this AOP we are using TPO inhibition not in the classical sense, but instead to refer to the empirical data derived from the assays commonly used to investigate environmental chemicals. Therefore, in the context of this AOP we are using TPO inhibition not in the classical sense, but instead to refer to the empirical data derived from the assays commonly used to investigate environmental chemicals.

Figure 1      illustrates the enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions mediated by TPO that result in the synthesis of thyroxine (T4) .



Inhibition of TPO can be reversible, with transient interaction between the enzyme and the chemical, or irreversible, whereby suicide substrates permanently inactivate the enzyme. Reversible and irreversible (isoflavones such as genistein) TPO inhibition may be determined by the chemical structure, may be concentration dependent, or may be influenced by other conditions, including the availability of iodine (Doerge and Chang, 2002).

The ontogeny of TPO has been determined using both direct and indirect evidence in mammals.  Available evidence suggests the 11th to 12th fetal week as the beginning of functional TPO in humans. In rodents, TPO function begins late in the second fetal week, with the first evidence of T4 secretion on gestational day 17 (Remy et al., 1980). Thyroid-specific genes appear in the thyroid gland according to a specific temporal pattern; thyroglobulin (Tg), TPO (Tpo), and TSH receptor (Tshr) genes are expressed by gestational day 14 in rats, and the sodium iodide symporter, NIS (Nis), is expressed by gestational day 16 in rats. Maturation to adult function is thought to occur within a few weeks after parturition in rats and mice, and within the first few months in neonatal humans (Santisteban and Bernal, 2005).  Tg is first detected in human fetuses starting at 5th week of gestation and rises throughout gestation (Thorpe-Beeston et al., 1992), but iodine trapping and T4 production does not occur until around 10-12 weeks. Also, the dimerization of Tg, a characteristic of adult TH storage, is not found until much later in human gestation (Pintar, 2000). In rats, Tg immunoreactivity does not appear until day 15 of gestation (Fukiishi et al., 1982; Brown et al., 2000). The vast majority of research and knowledge on Tg is from mammals, although genomic orthologs are known for a variety of other species (Holzer et al., 2016). It is important to note that prior to the onset of fetal thyroid function, THs are still required by the developing fetus which until that time relies solely on maternal sources. Chemical-induced TPO inhibition can affect synthesis in the maternal gland and in the fetal gland.

The components of the TH system responsible for TH synthesis are highly conserved across vertebrates. In fish and amphibians TPO and NIS inhibition result in an expected decrease of TH synthesis (Hornung et al., 2010; Tietge et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2016; Stinckens et al., 2016; Stinckens et al., 2020) like in mammals. Although the TH system is highly conserved across vertebrates, there are some taxon-specific considerations.

Zebrafish and fathead minnows are oviparous fish species in which maternal THs are transferred to the eggs and regulate early embryonic developmental processes during external (versus intra-uterine in mammals) development (Power et al., 2001; Campinho et al., 2014; Ruuskanen and Hsu, 2018) until embryonic TH synthesis is initiated.

Inhibition of TPO can only occur after activation of embryonic TH synthesis mediated by TPO. Endogenous transcription profiles of thyroid-related genes in zebrafish and fathead minnow showed that mRNA coding for TPO is maternally transferred in relatively high amounts with subsequent mRNA degradation followed by initiation of embryonic transcription around hatching (Vergauwen et al., 2018)."

Three subordinate annotations account for 593 (89.8%) of those genes: (i) vasculogenesis (96 genes, GO:0001570, defined as &ldquo;The differentiation of endothelial cells from progenitor cells during blood vessel development, and the de novo formation of blood vessels and tubes&rdquo;; (ii) angiogenesis (545 genes, GO:0001525, defined as &ldquo;Blood vessel formation when new vessels emerge from the proliferation of pre-existing blood vessels&rdquo;; and (iii) negative regulation of blood vessel morphogenesis (110 genes, GO:0016525, defined as &ldquo;Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of angiogenesis&rdquo;. Vegfr2 alone mapped to both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, consistent with its critical pro-angiogenic role. Vegfr1 alone mapped to negative regulation of blood vessel morphogenesis consistent with its role as an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor. 

 

The angiogenic state of a cell can be explained as a balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic signals. During vasculogenesis, endothelial progenitor cells (angioblasts) in the prevascular mesoderm undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition to assemble into nascent endothelial tubes. This is dependent on VEGF signaling as demonstrated by the lack of nascent tubules when the prevascular mesoderm from the early mouse embryo is treated with sFlt1 or VEGF antibodies [Argraves et al. 2002] and in vegfaa(-/-) zebrafish embryos lacking de novo assembly of angioblasts into major blood vessels (dorsal aorta, cardinal vein) [Jin et al. 2019]. The acquisition of arterial or venous fate during angioblast assembly occurs during vasculogenesis [Herbert and Stanier, 2011]. While VEGFA-signaling promotes arterial fate [Jin et al. 2019], it is not required by endothelial cells to maintain their organization as an endothelium and acquire arterial or venous fates [Argraves et al. 2002]. VEGFR1 plays a role in endothelial organization and prevents overgrowth but is not required for endothelial differentiation [Fong et al. 1995; Roberts et al. 2004]. The dynamics of endothelial sprouting from existing vasculature (angiogenesis) takes over from here. VEGF signaling induces filopodial extensions to sprout from extant endothelial cells at the site, forming an endothelial tip cell (EC-tip) as the critical VEGFR2-responsive event [Belair et al. 2016a and 2016b]. Together with lateral inhibition by Dll4-Notch signaling, the VEGF-Notch-Dll4 signaling system determines where the endothelium will sprout an EC-tip cell or stay behind as a proliferating EC-stalk cells [Williams et al. 2006; Oladipupo et al. 2011; Venkatraman et al. 2016]. Angiogenic sprouts migrate along VEGF corridors established by local signals and extracellular matrix interactions, lumenize to endothelial tubules, and form connections with other tubules [Herbert and Stanier, 2011]. This requires local suppression of cell motility, pruning of any overgrowth by apoptosis, and the formation of new cell-cell junctions [Eilkin and Adams, 2010]. VEGF primes the endothelium to respond to factors that promote EC-tip cells, tubulogenesis, cytoskeletal remodeling, basement membrane deposition, activation of focal adhesion, and pericyte recruitment and proliferation [Bowers et al. 2020]. VEGF priming requires VEGFR2, and the effect of VEGFR2 is selective to the priming response. Although the genetic signals and responses for vasculogenesis (de novo assembly of angioblasts) and angiogenesis (endothelial growth and sprouting) differ, MIE:305 is common to both processes embedded in KE:28."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/280","Thyroxine (T4) in neuronal tissue, Decreased","KE 280","Thyroid hormones (TH) are present in brain tissue of most vertebrate species, and thyroxine (T4) is converted to triiodothyronine (T3) locally in this tissue.  The amount of THs in brain is known to vary during development and to differ among brain regions (Calvo et al., 1990; Kester et al., 2004; Tu et al., 1999). In human cerebral cortex, T3 increases steadily from 13-weeks, reaching adult levels by 20 weeks post conception. This occurs despite very low and unchanging levels in fetal serum T3, when fetal serum T4 increases 3-fold over the same period. This indicates that T3 in fetal brain is locally generated from serum-derived T4 via the activity of deiodinases, primarily DIO2. DIO2 serves to convert T4 to T3. During this time in fetal development DIO3 activity, which converts T3 to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), remains very low in cortex.  In contrast, in other brain regions including hippocampus and cerebellum, T3 remains low throughout early and mid-gestation and corresponds with high activity of DIO3 in these brain regions. In late gestation and after birth, DIO3 levels drop in hippocampus and cerebellum with a corresponding increase in T3 concentrations (Kester et al., 2004). 

A similar spatial and temporal profile of deiodinase activity and corresponding brain hormone concentrations has been observed in rodent brain (Calvo et al., 1990; Tu et al., 1999). In the rat, either whole brain or cortex have been preferentially assessed due to the low levels of hormones present and the small tissue volumes make quantitification difficult. Brain T3 and T4 rise in parallel from gestational day 10 to gestational day 20 in rat. They are typically both quite low until gestational 17 with steep increases between GD18 and GD20 corresponding to the onset of fetal thyroid function (Calvo et al., 1990; Ruiz de Ono et al., 1988; Obergon et al., 1981). Just before birth, brain T3 and T4 concentrations are about one-third to one-half that of adult brain. Brain development in the early postnatal period in rat is roughly equivalent to the 3rd trimester in humans such that adult levels of T3 and T4 in brain are not reached in rodents until the 2nd-3rd postnatal week.

For THs to gain access to brain tissue they need to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) which regulates the active transport of TH into neurons. Many transporter proteins have been identified, and the monocarboxylate transporters (Mct8, Mct10) and anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1c1) show the highest degree of affinity towards TH and are prevalent in brain (Jansen et al., 2007; Mayer et al., 2014).  Transporters express a distinct distribution pattern that varies by tissue and age (Friesema et al., 2005; Henneman et al., 2001; Visser et al., 2007; Heuer et al., 2005; Muller and Heuer, 2007). Although several transporters have been identified, current knowledge of cell specific profile of transporters is limited. 

Most of the hormone transported across the blood brain barrier is in the form of T4, primarily through the cellular membrane transporters (e.g., OATP1c1 transporter) into the astrocyte (Visser and Visser, 2012; Sugiyama et al., 2003; Tohyama et al., 2004). Within the astrocyte, T4 is converted into T3 via the local activity of deiodinase 2 (DIO2) (Guadano-Ferraz et al., 1997).  A small amount of T3 may cross the blood brain barrier directly via the T3-specific transporter, MCT8 (Heuer et al., 2005). Although in mature brain T3 derives partially from the circulation and from the deiodination of T4, in the fetal brain T3 is exclusively a product of T4 deiodination (Calvo et al., 1990; Grijota-Martinez et al., 2011). In both cases, only the required amount of T3 is utilized in neurons and the excess is degraded by the neuron-specific deiodinase DIO3 (Tu et al., 1999; St. Germain et al., 2009; Hernandez et al., 2010).

Both deiodinase and transporter expression in brain peak in different brain regions at different times in fetal and neonatal life (Kester et al., 2004; Bates et al., 1999; Muller and Heuer, 2014; Heuer, 2007). Collectively, these spatial and temporal patterns of transporter expression and deiodinase activity provide exquisite control of brain T3 available for nuclear receptor activation and regulated gene expression."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/281","Thyroxine (T4) in serum, Decreased","KE 281","All iodothyronines are derived from the modification of tyrosine molecules (Taurog, 2000). There are two biologically active thyroid hormones (THs) in serum, triiodothyronine (T3) and T4, and a few less active iodothyronines, reverse T3 (rT3),  and 3,3&#39;-Diiodothyronine (3,5-T2). T4 is the predominant TH in circulation, comprising approximately 80% of the TH excreted from the thyroid gland in mammals and is the pool from which the majority of T3 in serum is generated (Zoeller et al., 2007). As such, serum T4 changes usually precede changes in other serum THs. Decreased thyroxine (T4) in serum results from one or more MIEs upstream and is considered a key biomarker of altered TH homeostasis (DeVito et al., 1999).

Serum T4 is used as a biomarker of TH status because the circulatory system serves as the major transport and delivery system for TH delivery to tissues. The majority of THs in the blood are bound to transport proteins (Bartalena and Robbins, 1993). In serum, it is the unbound, or &lsquo;free&rsquo; form of the hormone that is thought to be available for transport into tissues. Free hormones are approximately 0.03 and 0.3 percent for T4 and T3, respectively. There are major species differences in the predominant binding proteins and their affinities for THs (see below). However, there is broad agreement that changes in serum concentrations of THs is diagnostic of thyroid disease or chemical-induced disruption of thyroid homeostasis across vertebrates (DeVito et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2009; Zoeller et al., 2007; Carr and Pati&ntilde;o, 2011).

Normal serum T4 reference ranges can be species and lifestage specific. In rodents, serum THs are low in the fetal circulation, increasing as the fetal thyroid gland becomes functional on gestational day 17, just a few days prior to birth. After birth serum hormones increase steadily, peaking at two weeks, and falling slightly to adult levels by postnatal day 21 (Walker et al., 1980; Harris et al., 1978; Goldey et al., 1995; Lau et al., 2003). Similarly, in humans, adult reference ranges for THs do not reflect the normal ranges for children at different developmental stages, with TH concentrations highest in infants, still increased in childhood, prior to a decline to adult levels coincident with pubertal development (Corcoran et al. 1977; Kapelari et al., 2008).

In some frog species, there is an analogous peak in THs in tadpoles that starts around embryonic NF stage 56, peaks at stage 62 and the declines to lower levels by stage 56 (Sternberg et al., 2011; Leloup and Buscaglia, 1977). 

Additionally, ample evidence is available from studies investigating responses to inhibitors of TH synthesis in fish. For example, Stinckens et al. (2020) showed reduced whole body T4 concentrations in zebrafish larvae exposed to 50 or 100 mg/L methimazole, a potent TPO inhibitor, from immediately after fertilization until 21 or 32 days of age. Exposure to 37 or 111 mg/L propylthiouracil also reduced T4 levels after exposure up to 14, 21 and 32 days in the same study. Walter et al. (2019) showed that propylthiouracil had no effect on T4 levels in 24h old zebrafish, but decreased T4 levels of 72h old zebrafish. This difference is probably due to the onset of embryonic TH production between the age of 24 and 72 hours (Opitz et al., 2011). Stinckens et al. (2016) showed that exposure to 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), an environmentally relevant TPO inhibitor, decreased whole body T4 levels in continuously exposed 5 and 32 day old zebrafish larvae. A high concentration of MBT also decreased whole body T4 levels in 6 day old fathead minnows, but recovery was observed at the age of 21 days although the fish were kept in the exposure medium (Nelson et al., 2016). Crane et al. (2006) showed decreased T4 levels in 28 day old fathead minnows continuously exposed to 32 or 100 &micro;g/L methimazole."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/286","Altered, Transcription of genes by the androgen receptor","KE 286","This KE refers to transcription of genes by the androgen receptor (AR) as occurring in complex biological systems such as tissues and organs in vivo. Rather than measuring individual genes, this KE aims to capture patterns of effects at transcriptome level in specific target cells/tissues. In other words, it can be replaced by specific KEs for individual adverse outcomes as information becomes available, for example the transcriptional toxicity response in prostate tissue for AO: prostate cancer, perineum tissue for AO: reduced AGD, etc.  AR regulates many genes that differ between tissues and life stages and, importantly, different gene transcripts within individual cells can go in either direction since AR can act as both transcriptional activator and suppressor. Thus, the &lsquo;directionality&rsquo; of the KE cannot be either reduced or increased, but instead describe an altered transcriptome. 

The Androgen Receptor and its function

The AR belongs to the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family. It is a ligand-activated transcription factor with three domains: the N-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domain, and the ligand-binding domain with the latter being the most evolutionary conserved (Davey and Grossmann 2016). Androgens (such as dihydrotestosterone and testosterone) are AR ligands and act by binding to the AR in androgen-responsive tissues (Davey and Grossmann 2016). Human AR mutations and mouse knockout models have established a fundamental role for AR in masculinization and spermatogenesis (Maclean et al.; Walters et al. 2010; Rana et al. 2014). The AR is also expressed in many other tissues such as bone, muscles, ovaries and within the immune system (Rana et al. 2014).

 

Altered transcription of genes by the AR as a Key Event

Upon activation by ligand-binding, the AR translocates from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus, dimerizes, binds to androgen response elements in the DNA to modulate gene transcription (Davey and Grossmann 2016). The transcriptional targets vary between cells and tissues, as well as with developmental stages and is also dependent on available co-regulators (Bevan and Parker 1999; Heemers and Tindall 2007). It should also be mentioned that the AR can work in other &lsquo;non-canonial&rsquo; ways such as non-genomic signaling, and ligand-independent activation (Davey &amp; Grossmann, 2016; Estrada et al, 2003; Jin et al, 2013). 

A large number of known, and proposed, target genes of AR canonical signaling have been identified by analysis of gene expression following treatments with AR agonists (Bolton et al. 2007; Ngan et al. 2009, Jin et al. 2013)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/289","Decrease, Translocator protein (TSPO)","KE 289","Biological state

Translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein implicated in cholesterol import to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Besman et al. 1989).

Biological compartments

The TSPO is present in virtually all mammalian peripheral tissues (Zisterer and Williams 1997), however highly prominent TSPO protein expression has been identified in steroidogenic tissues (R. R. Anholt et al. 1985), (Wang, Fan, and Papadopoulos 2012). The presence of TSOP has been confirmed in Leydig and Sertoli cells (Morohaku, Phuong, and Selvaraj 2013), granulosa cells (Amsterdam and Suh 1991) and to a lesser extent in thecal cells (Morohaku, Phuong, and Selvaraj 2013). In subcellular fractions, binding sites for the TSOP have been identified to be present in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (R. R. Anholt et al. 1985), (R. Anholt et al. 1986). Transcriptional regulation of TSPO genes has been examined and recently reviewed (Morohaku, Phuong, and Selvaraj 2013).

General role in biology: regulation of lipid transport

TSPO mediates the delivery of the substrate cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial side chain cleavage enzyme P450scc (Besman et al. 1989). TSPO ligands stimulate steroidogenesis and induce cholesterol movement from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (Besman et al. 1989)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/298","Insufficiency, Vascular","KE 298","Embryonic blood vessels form in a reproducible pattern that interfaces with other embryonic structures and tissues [Hogan et al. 2004]. Many human diseases, including stroke, retinopathy, and cancer, are associated with the vascular biology, including endothelial cells and pericytes that establish the blood-brain barrier and control cerebrovascular exchanges [Bautch and James, 2009; Eichmann and Thomas, 2013; Saili et al. 2017]. Functionally, blood vessel morphogenesis is critical for providing oxygen, nutrients and molecular signals to developing tissues [Maltepe et al. 1997; Vargesson, 2003; Chung and Ferrara, 2011; Eshkar-Oren et al. 2015]. The developing vascular network is shaped into a hierarchical system of arteries and veins, through progressive effects on blood vessel arborization (microvasculature) and pruning (angio-adaptation) [Jin et al. 2017]. The former is morpho-regulatory whereas the reshaping is influenced by regional changes in blood flow and local metabolic demands [Tran et al. 2007]. Evidence supports the ability of physiological parameters such as oxygen and glucose concentrations to affect the expression of genes critical for developmental angiogenesis [Maltepe and Simon, 1998]. Growth in tissue mass during organogenesis is thought to lead to the formation of hypoxic/nutrient-deprived cells. The subsequent activation of sensors such as HIF-1 [Xia et al. 2009; Oladipupo et al. 2011; Li et al. 2018] and ARNT [Maltepe et al. 1997; Abbott and Buckalew, 2000] that rapidly trans-activate the expression of genes such as VEGF that drive angiogenesis. 


While mammalian embryos become sensitive to hypoxia during early organogenesis, the small size of zebrafish embryos renders this species less vulnerable to hypoxia than vertebrate counterparts; however, the genetic control of microvascular development is conserved among vertebrate species as evidenced by hypoxia-responsive signaling (HIF-1) via local oxygen-sensing gradients in the zebrafish, chick and mouse embryo [Hogan et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2017; Gerri et al. 2017]. The neural tube, for example, provides vascular patterning signals that direct formation of the perineural vascular plexus (PNVP) that encompasses the neural tube at mid-gestation [Hogan et al. 2004]. This process is temporally and spatially associated with Vegfa expression as the neural tube signal through VEGFR-2. Mesodermal VEGFR-2 expression is localized to the lateral portion of the somite and later to sclerotomal cells surrounding the neural tube under the positive control of BMP4 signaling and negative control by Noggin, a BMP4 antagonist [Nimmagadda et al. 2005]. Reciprocal signaling between VEGF-induced endothelial cells and neuroprogenitor cells enhanced formation of the brain neurovascular unit [Vissapragada et al. 2014]. In transgenic zebrafish embryos, the VEGFR-2 antagonist, Vatalanib produced a direct concentration-dependent progression of impaired intersegmental vessel (ISV) outgrowth in early embryos, increased rates of malformed hatched larva, and reduced survival in juvenile cohorts [Tal et al. 2014]. These data show that disruption in the early embryo has a lasting impact on advanced life stages. 


Another key cell sensing activity is the recruitment of macrophage (microglia?) cells that secrete pro-angiogenic cytokines and proteases, remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) and providing survival and guidance cues to endothelial cells [Gerri et al. 2017]. Macrophages play crucial roles at each step of the angiogenic cycle, from sprouting to maturation and remodelling of the vascular plexus through angiopoietin-TIE2 signaling [Du Cheyne et al. 2020], which is known to synergize with the VEGF-pathway during developmental angiogenesis [Li et al. 2014]. A seminal study showed that loss of immature blood vessels is the primary cause of Thalidomide-induced teratogenesis in the chick embryo, where anti-angiogenic but not anti-inflammatory analogues of Thalidomide induced limb reduction defects. Outgrowth and remodeling of more mature blood vessels delayed, whereas newly formed angiogenic vessels were lost prior to limb dysmorphogenesis and altered patterns of gene expression [Therapontos et al. 2009; Vargesson, 2015]. Vascular insufficiency is likely important in human embryos where the window of vulnerability to Thalidomide-induced phocomelia precedes full establishment of the adult arterial pattern by the 8th week of gestation [Hootnick et al. 2016; Hootnick et al. 2017; Vargesson and Hootnick, 2017]. 

As such, a chemical&rsquo;s potential to disrupt vascular patterning and/or remodeling during organogenesis can have profound effects on many systems, including: early limb development [Beedie et al. 2016a, 2016b, 2017 and 2020]; neurovascular development [Hogan et al. 2004; Hallene et al. 2006; Bautch and James, 2009; Eichman and Thomas, 2013; Vissapragada et al. 2014;  Fiorentino et al. 2016; Uwamori et al. 2017; Huang, 2020]; and utero-placental development [Abbott and Buckalew, 2000; Douglas et al. 2009; Rutland et al. 2009; Chen, 2014; Araujo et al. 2021]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/3","Reduction, 17beta-estradiol synthesis by ovarian granulosa cells","KE 3","Like all steroids, estradiol is a cholesterol derivative. Estradiol synthesis in ovary is mediated by a number of enzyme catalyzed reactions involving cyp11 (cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme), cyp 17 (17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), 3beta hydroxysteroid dehyrogenase, 17beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and cyp19 (aromatase). Among those enzyme catalyzed reactions, conversion of testosterone to estradiol, catalyzed by aromatase, is considered to be rate limiting for estradiol synthesis. Within the ovary, aromatase expression and activity is primarily localized in the granulosa cells (reviewed in (Norris 2007; Yaron 1995; Havelock et al. 2004) and others). Reactions involved in synthesis of C-19 androgens are primarily localized in the theca cells and C-19 androgens diffuse from the theca into granulosa cells where aromatase can catalyze their conversion to C-18 estrogens."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/305","Inhibition, VegfR2","KE 305","The VEGFR system is an important molecular regulator of physiological and pathological blood vessel development. The central players are vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3) and five VEGF ligands that bind and activate these receptors during vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and lymphogenesis [Shibuya, 2013]. The MIE:305 target, VEGFR2, belongs to Class IV transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that play critical roles in the origin and progression of many adverse outcomes linked to vascular biology. Direct evidence supporting its role in developmental angiogenesis comes from functional inactivation in mouse VEGFR knockout models. For example, a targeted mutation in flt-1 showed Vegfr1(-/-) embryos formed endothelial cells in both embryonic and extra-embryonic regions but assembled these cells into abnormal vascular channels and died in utero at mid-somite stages [Fong et al. 1995]. Functional inactivation of flk-1 showed that Vegfr2(-/-) embryos died much earlier due to deficiencies in hematopoeisis and organized blood vessels [Shalaby et al. 1995]. It&rsquo;s endogenous ligand, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A), in particular the VEGF165 splice variant, plays a key role in the regulation of angiogenesis during early embryogenesis. Mouse embryos heterozygous for the Vegf gene died from impaired angiogenesis and hematopoeisis in Vegf(+/-) heterozygotes during organogenesis [Ferrara et al. 1996]. Nullizygotes died earlier showing that progressive severity in a quantitative gene dose-dependent manner [Carmeliet et al. 1996]. VEGF-A is a soluble protein that acts directly on endothelial cells and their precursors through VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk-1). The former is a decoy receptor that traps VEGF-A into corridors preventing interaction with the active receptor, VEGFR2 [Roberts et al. 2004]. Environmental stressors (drugs/chemicals) may perturb VEGFR-dependent angiogenesis [Belair et al. 1996a,b]. Multiple mechanisms are involved, including direct effects on VEGFR2 structure-function as well as VEGF-A bioavailability or binding kinetics [Gustafsdottir et al. 2008]. The duality is relevant to MIE:305 because receptor affinity for VEGF is ten-fold higher at VEGFR1, whereas kinase activity is ten-fold higher at VEGFR2 [Fischer et al. 2008; Shibuya, 2013]. As such, VEGFR2 promotes angiogenesis whereas VEGFR1 acts as a ligand-trap to prevent VEGF-A interaction with VEGFR2 [Hiratsuka et al. 1998]. In this AOP, decreased VEGFR2 binding is the quantitative basis for an effect of stressors on VEGFR2 activation of the &lsquo;master switch&rsquo; in developmental angiogenesis."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/341","Impairment, Learning and memory","KE 341","(Adapted from KE: 341 - in blue) 

Learning can be defined as the process by which new information is acquired to establish knowledge by systematic study or by trial and error (Ono, 2009). Two types of learning are considered in neurobehavioral studies: a) associative learning and b) non- associative learning. Associative learning is based on making associations between different events. In associative learning, a subject learns the relationship among two different stimuli or between the stimulus and the subject&rsquo;s behavior. On the other hand, non-associative learning can be defined as an alteration in the behavioral response that occurs over time in response to a single type of stimulus. Habituation and sensitization are some examples of non-associative learning. 

The memory formation requires acquisition, retention and retrieval of information in the brain, which is characterized by the non- conscious recall of information (Ono, 2009). There are three main categories of memory, including sensory memory, short-term or working memory (up to a few hours) and long-term memory (up to several days or even much longer). 

Learning and memory depend upon the coordinated action of different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems constituting functionally integrated neural networks (D&rsquo;Hooge and DeDeyn, 2001). Among the many brain areas engaged in the acquisition of, or retrieval of, a learned event, the hippocampal-based memory systems have received the most study. For example, the hippocampus has been shown to be critical for spatial-temporal memory, visio-spatial memory, verbal and narrative memory, and episodic and autobiographical memory (Burgess et al., 2000; Vorhees and Williams, 2014). However, there is substantial evidence that fundamental learning and memory functions are not mediated by the hippocampus alone but require a network that includes, in addition to the hippocampus, anterior thalamic nuclei, mammillary bodies cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia (Aggleton and Brown, 1999; Doya, 2000; Mitchell et al., 2002, Toscano and Guilarte, 2005; Gilbert et al., 2006, 2016). Thus, damage to variety of 

 

brain structures can potentially lead to impairment of learning and memory. The main learning areas and pathways are similar in rodents and primates, including man (Eichenbaum, 2000; Stanton and Spear, 1990). While the prefrontal cortex and frontostriatal neural circuits have been identified as the primary sites of higher-order cognition in vertebrates, invertebrates utilize paired mushroom bodies, shown to contain ~300,000 neurons in honey bees (Menzel, 2012; Puig et al., 2014). 

For the purposes of this KE (AO), impaired learning and memory is defined as an organism&rsquo;s inability to establish new associative or non-associative relationships, or sensory, short-term or long-term memories which can be measured using different behavioral tests described below."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/344","N/A, Liver fibrosis","KE 344","Liver fibrosis results from perpetuation of the normal wound healing response, as a result of repeated cycles of hepatocyte injury and repair and is a dynamic process, characterised by an excessive deposition of ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins including glycoproteins, collagens, and proteoglycans. It is usually secondary to hepatic injury and inflammation, and progresses at different rates depending on the aetiology of liver disease and is also influenced by environmental and genetic factors. If fibrosis continues, it disrupts the normal architecture of the liver, altering the normal function of the organ and ultimately leading to liver damage. Cirrhosis represents the final stage of fibrosis. It is characterised by fibrous septa which divide the parenchyma into regenerative nodules which leads to vascular modifications and portal hypertension with its complications of variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome. In addition, this condition is largely associated with hepatocellular carcinoma with a further increase in the relative mortality rate (Bataller and Brenner, 2005; Merck Manual,2015) 

Liver fibrosis is an important health issue with clear regulatory relevance. The burden of disease attributable to liver fibrosis is quite high; progressive hepatic fibrosis, ultimately leading to cirrhosis, is a significant contributor to global health burden (Lim and Kim, 2008). In the European Union, 0.1 % of the population is affected by cirrhosis, the most advanced stage of liver fibrosis with full architectural disturbances (Blachier et al., 2013). Besides the epidemiological relevance, liver fibrosis also imposes a considerable economic burden on society. Indeed, the only curative therapy for chronic liver failure is liver transplantation. More than 5.500 orthotopic liver transplantations are currently performed in Europe on a yearly basis, costing up to &euro;100.000 the first year and &euro;10.000 yearly thereafter (Van Agthoven et al., 2001)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/348","Malformation, Male reproductive tract","KE 348","Biological state

Male reproductive tract malformations (congenital malformation of male genitalia) comprise any physical abnormality of the male internal or external genitalia present at birth. Some result from excessive or deficient androgen effect, others result from teratogenic effects, or are associated with anomalies of other parts of the body in a recognizable pattern (i.e., a syndrome). The cause of many of these birth defects is unknown.

Hypospadias is a defect of the urogenital system, a malformation in which the urethra opens on the underside of the penis instead of the tip. It results from an incomplete closure of the urethral folds, leaving a split on the penis (Kalfa, Philibert, and Sultan 2009). When the urethra opens to the glans or corona of the penis, it is called distal, whereas opening to the shaft or penoscrotal area defines hypospadias as proximal. Androgens regulate the masculinization of external genitalia. Therefore any defects in androgen biosynthesis, metabolism or action during foetal development can cause hypospadias. Gene defects causing disorders of testicular differentiation, conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone or mutations in the androgen receptor can also result in hypospadias (Kalfa et al. 2008). In about 20% of patients with isolated hypospadias there are signs of endocrine abnormalities by the time of diagnosis (Rey et al. 2005). The majority of hypospadias are believed to have a multifactorial etiology, although a small percentage do result from single gene mutations (Baskin, Himes, and Colborn 2001). The only treatment of hypospadias is surgery, thus, prevention is imperative.

The term &quot;neurodegeneration&quot; can be applied to several conditions that result in the loss of nerve structure and function, and neuronal loss by necrosis and/or apoptosis

Neurodegeneration is a key aspect of a large number of diseases that come under the umbrella of &ldquo;neurodegenerative diseases&quot; including Huntington&#39;s, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. All of these conditions lead to progressive brain damage and neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer&#39;s disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions, with gross atrophy of the affected regions; symptoms include memory loss.

Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) results from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta; symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor.

Several observations suggest correlative links between environmental exposure and neurodegenerative diseases, but only few suggest causative links:

Only an extremely small proportion (less than 5%) of neurodegenerative diseases are caused by genetic mutations (Narayan and Dragounov, 2017). The remainders are thought to be caused by the following:

&middot;      A build up of toxic proteins in the brain (Evin et al., 2006)

&middot;      A loss of mitochondrial function that leads to the oxidative stress and creation of neurotoxic molecules that trigger cell death (apoptotic, necrotic or autophagy) (Cobley et al., 2018)

&middot;      Changes in the levels and activities of neurotrophic factors (Kazim and Iqbal, 2016; Machado et al., 2016; Rodriguez et al., 2014)

&middot;      Variations in the activity of neural networks (Greicius and Kimmel, 2012)

Protein aggregation: the correlation between neurodegenerative disease and protein aggregation in the brain has long been recognised, but a causal relationship has not been unequivocally established (Lansbury et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2016). The dynamic nature of protein aggregation mean that, despite progress in understanding its mechanisms, its relationship to disease is difficult to determine in the laboratory.

Nevertheless, drug candidates that inhibit aggregation are now being tested in the clinic. These have the potential to slow the progression of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease and related disorders and could, if administered pre-symptomatically, drastically reduce the incidence of these diseases.

Loss of mitochondrial function: many lines of evidence suggest that mitochondria have a central role in neurodegenerative diseases (Lin and Beal, 2006). Mitochondria are critical regulators of cell death, a key feature of neurodegeneration. Dysfunction of mitochondria induces oxidative stress, production of free radicals, calcium overload, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. In all major examples of these diseases there is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an impressive number of disease- specific proteins interact with mitochondria. Thus, therapies targeting basic mitochondrial processes, such as energy metabolism or free-radical generation, or specific interactions of disease-related proteins with mitochondria, hold great promise.

Decreased level of neurotrophic factors: decreased levels and activities of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have been described in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington&#39;s disease, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease (Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2009). These studies have led to the development of experimental strategies aimed at increasing BDNF levels in the brains of animals that have been genetically altered to mimic the aforementioned human diseases, with a view to ultimately influencing the clinical treatment of these conditions. Therefore BDNF treatment is being considered as a beneficial and feasible therapeutic approach in the clinic.

Variations in the activity of neural networks: Patients with various neurodegenerative disorders show remarkable fluctuations in neurological functions, even during the same day (Palop et al., 2006). These fluctuations cannot be caused by sudden loss or gain of nerve cells. Instead, it is likely that they reflect variations in the activity of neural networks and, perhaps, chronic intoxication by abnormal proteins that the brain is only temporarily able to overcome.

Neurodegeneration in relation to COVID19 

SARS-CoV-2 patients present elevated plasma levels of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL), which is a well-known biochemical indicator of neuronal injury (Kanberg et al., 2020). Postmortem brain autopsies demonstrate virus invasion to different brain regions, including the hypothalamus and olfactory bulb, accompanied by neural death and demyelination (Archie and Cucullo 2020; Heneka et al. 2020).

Autopsy results of patients with SARS showed ischemic neuronal damage and demyelination; viral RNA was detected in brain tissue, particularly accumulating in and around the hippocampus (Gu et al. 2005).

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations in SARS-CoV-2 patients show multifocal hyperintense white matter lesions and cortical signal abnormalities (particularly in the medial temporal lobe) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), along with intracerebral hemorrhagic and microhemorrhagic lesions, and leptomeningeal enhancement (Kandemirli et al. 2020; Kremer et al. 2020; Mohammadi et al., 2020).

Moreover, eight COVID-19 patients with signs of encephalopathy had anti&ndash;SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their CSF, and 4 patients had CSF positive for 14-3-3-protein suggesting ongoing neurodegeneration (Alexopoulos et al. 2020)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/36","Inhibition, Aromatase","KE 36","Inhibition of cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19; specifically cyp19a1a in fish).

Site of action: The site of action for the molecular initiating event is the ovarian granulosa cells.

While many vertebrates have a single isoform of aromatase, fish are known to have two isoforms. CYP19a1a is predominantly expressed in ovary while cyp19a1b is predominantly expressed in brain (Callard et al. 2001; Cheshenko et al. 2008). For the purposes of this MIE, when applied to fish, the assumed effect is on cyp19a1a. However, given that both isoforms show similar sensitivity to aromatase inhibitors (Hinfray et al. 2006) and catalyze the same reaction, discrimination of specific isoforms is not viewed as critical in relative to determining downstream key events resulting from aromatase inhibition in ovarian granulosa cells.

Responses at the macromolecular level: Aromatase catalyzes three sequential oxidation steps (i.e., KEGG reactions R02501, R04761, R03087 or R01840, R04759, R02351; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) involved in the conversion of C-19 androgens (e.g., testosterone, androstenedione) to C-18 estrogens (e.g., 17&beta;-estradiol, estrone). Aromatase inhibitors interfere with one or more of these reactions, leading to reduced efficiency in converting C-19 androgens into C-18 estrogens. Therefore, inhibition of aromatase activity results in decreased rate of 17&beta;-estradiol (and presumably estrone) production by the ovary."

Porphyria is a disorder in which the disturbance of heme biosynthesis results in accumulation and excretion of porphyrins[1]. A variety of porphyrias exist depending on which enzyme in the pathway is deficient (Figure 1). In the case of chemically induced urporphyria, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), which converts uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen, is inhibited. In humans, this disorder is known as porphyria cutanea tarda and may be caused by chemical exposure or a hereditary deficiency in UROD[4]. The accumulation of porphyrins in the liver causes cirrhosis, mild fatty infiltration, patchy focal necrosis, and inflammation of portal tracts. When the activity of UROD is reduced to less than 30% of normal, the disorder manifests as an overt skin disease; the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin causes photosensitization that is characterized by fragile skin, superficial erosions, sub-epidermal bullae, hypertrichosis, patchy pigmentation and scarring[5]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/373","Formation, Pro-mutagenic DNA Adducts","KE 373","Evidence Supporting Essentiality

Strong

Evidence supporting the formation of an AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adduct as the molecular initiating event (MIE) is strong and stems from many datasets in different biological systems. The formation of N7-AFB1-G DNA adducts after AFB1 exposure has been demonstrated across phyla, from bacteria through yeast, fish, birds, and including many mammalian systems up through non-human primates and humans (Croy et al., 1978; IARC, 1993; Cupid et al., 2004).

The reactive metabolite AFB1 exo-epoxide intercalates into DNA and then binds to the nucleophilic N7-G residue via an SN2 reaction. This N7-G DNA adduct can then spontaneously ring-open to form the more highly pro-mutagenic 8,9-dihydro-8-(2,6-diamino-4-oxo-3,4-pyrimid-9-yl-foramido-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1, or formamidopyrimidine adduct, AFB1-FAPy (Brown et al., 2006).

The essentiality of this MIE is demonstrated by the effects of modulation of metabolism to reactive forms. Inhibition of activation results in reduced formation of the critical exo-epoxide. Likewise, increased GST activity results in increased metabolism of the exo-epoxide to less toxic forms. In both cases, less reactive metabolite is available to form DNA adducts, resulting in fewer adducts (Guengerich et al., 1996). Pre-treatment of rats with oltipraz provides a specific example, wherein a 65-70% reduction in AFB1-induced DNA adducts was demonstrated due to increased GST activity; this corresponds with a subsequent 100% reduction in liver tumors (Roebuck et al., 1991; Kensler et al., 1998).


Another line of evidence for essentiality of the MIE is the recognized species difference in sensitivity to AFB1-induced liver tumors between mice and rats. Mice, with considerably increased metabolic activation of AFB1 to the exo-epoxide compared with rats, are nonetheless much less sensitive to AFB1-induced liver tumors (Degen and Neumann, 1981). This difference is believed to be due to the constitutive presence of GST-alpha activity in mice vs. rats, where this activity is not found (Monroe and Eaton, 1987).

Taxonomic Applicabilty

AFB1-induced DNA adduct measurements have focused mainly on mammalian species, including rats, mice, non-human primates, and humans; however, all species capable of metabolic activation of AFB1 to the exo-epoxide&mdash;including yeast, birds, and fish--will form the pro-mutagenic N7-AFB1-G DNA and AFB1-FAPy adducts described above (IARC, 1993).

How this Key Event works

The initial AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adduct is the 8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 adduct, or N7-AFB1-G (Croy et al., 1971). Once the exo-epoxide is bound to the N7-guanine, it can then ring-open to form the more highly pro-mutagenic 8,9-dihydro-8-(2,6-diamino-4-oxo-3,4-pyrimid-9-yl-foramido)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1, or formamidopyrimidine adduct, AFB1-FAPy (Brown et al., 2006).

The N7-AFB1-G adduct has a short half-life; it can spontaneously depurinate, leaving an apurinic (AP) site, a DNA lesion that typically is rapidly repaired (Denissenko et al., 1998). AP sites are the predominant background or endogenous lesion identified to date in DNA from control rats, with about 30,000 AP sites/cell present ubiquitously and continually (Swenberg et al., 2011). Thus, although the N7-AFB1-G is considered to be a pro-mutagenic lesion due to its capability to intercalate in DNA and its bulkiness (Bailey et al., 1996), it may not be the most important DNA adduct in the process of AFB1-induced tumorigenesis.

The AFB1-FAPy adduct has a longer half-life and demonstrates higher mutagenic efficiency or potency than the N7-AFB1-G (Brown et al., 2006). Data indicate that about 20% of the N7-AFB1-G adducts undergo opening of the ring to become AFB1-FAPy adducts (Bedard et al., 2005; Croy and Wogan, 1981a); others report that by about 24 post-exposure, AFB1-FAPy adducts predominate (Boysen et al., 2009; Croy and Wogan, 1981a). These adducts do not spontaneously depurinate, thus can accumulate over time, which likely contributes to their increased mutagenic efficacy (Smela et al., 2002).

The pro-mutagenicity of these two adducts was demonstrated by assessing their mutant frequencies (MF) in non-human primate-derived cell line COS-7; these cells employ an error-prone replication bypass repair system. The N7-AFB1-G adducts demonstrated a MF of 45% in COS-7 cells (Lin et al., 2014a), while the N7-AFB1-FAPy adduct MF was 97% (Lin et al., 2014b)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/376","Increased, Induced Mutations in Critical Genes","KE 376","Following the formation of DNA adducts, which are either mis-repaired or not repaired, the sequence of base pairs in the DNA is changed due to insertion of an incorrect base opposite the DNA adduct during DNA replication, so that a G is permanently replaced by a T. This type of mutation is observed in the mutants seen in surrogate gene mutation assays using AFB1 exposureA high frequency of codon 249 p53 mutations occurs in human tumors in high AFB1 exposure regions.Hence, codon 249 of the p53 gene contains a base pair susceptible to insufficient or misrepair of DNA adducts.

Puisieux et al. (1991) provide evidence that the AFB1 epoxide adduct binds preferentially to codon 249 of the p53 gene. Using a plasmid with containing full-length human p53 DNA, adduct formation was observed in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 (a total of 1086 bases) and 20% of the bases were targeted by AFB1 with a preference for guanine residues. Binding of AFB1 to p53 sequences was restricted to fewer residues and was more specific for guanine than was the binding of B[a]P (Puisieux et al.,1991). Binding of AFB1 in the region around codon 249 of p53 AFB1 was reported to be &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; than that of B[a]P. The last nucleotide of codon 249 is a guanine and was targeted by AFB1 but not by B[a]P. This guanine residue is the mutational hotspot in human liver cancers from patients in high AFB1 exposure regions.

While mutations at codon 249 of the p53 gene have been observed in association with HCC in humans, the question remains whether this mutation occurs as a direct result of adduct formation at this site or by some different mechanism..In human HepG2 hepatocytes exposed to microsomally activated AFB1, a dose-dependent increase in G:C to T:A transversions were observed at 10 additional locations using ligation-mediated PCR, and at 4 additional locations using terminal-transferred dependent PCR.(Denissenko et al.,1998). These authors suggest that codon 249 may not present a key adduct site. However, other more recently published data identified codon 249 of the P53 gene as an unusually mutagenic adduct conformation based on the local DNA sequence and concluded that a higher mutation rate may occur there rather than at other locations because of increased DNA polymerase bypass (Pussieux et al., 1991; Lin et al., 2014a,b).

Induced Mutation in Critical Genes

The AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adduct is either not repaired or is mis-repaired resulting in a mutation in one or more critical genes. In bacteria and mammalian cells (both in vitro and in vivo) the primary mutation associated with AFB1 is a guanine to thymine transversion (Foster et al., 1983; Dycaico et al., 1996). A G:T transversion is expected for the pro-mutagenic DNA adduct AFB1-FAPy.

A specific critical mutation in codon 249 of the p53 gene has been identified in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (See section below on essentiality).

Level of Biological Organization : Cellular

The induction of mutation occurs within the nucleus of cells and involves permanent alterations in the primary DNA sequence that is passed to subsequent cell generations and, thus, is heritable.

Evidence Supporting Essentiality

Strong

A specific critical mutation in the p53 gene has been identified in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Demonstrating that AFB1 can induce this specific p53 gene mutation would be the highest level of evidence that AFB1-induced HCC involves mutation as a KE. Absent such information, the next best level of evidence is the induction of the specific type of mutation (G:C to T:A transversion) in a variety of gene mutation assays measuring a range of target genes.

The codon 249 mutation is present in a significant proportion of human HCCs. In fact codon 249 mutation is detected in up to 50% of liver cancers in Qidong, China (Hsu et al., 1991) and in Mozambique, both areas with high likelihood of AFB1 exposure. The codon 249 G:C to T:A mutation in the third base is seen in up to 75% of HCC in high-incidence areas of China and East Africa (Gouas et al., 2009). In contrast, this specific mutation is very rare in HCC from areas with no or low exposure to AFB1 (Hsu et al. 1991 and Bressac et al. Nature, 350:429-431, 1991). This mutation is also very rare in other types of tumors (Gouas et al., 2009). According to Gouas et al. (2009), populations with AFB1 exposure are likely to be exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) as well and the effects of each are difficult to separate.This mutation is very rare in HCC from non/low -aflatoxin areas (Hsu et al. 1991 and Bressac et al., 1991) and also very rare in other types of tumors.

Some indirect evidence of the essentiality of mutation in tumor development is provided by the clear species difference between adult mice and adult rats both in the induction of surrogate gene mutations and in the induction of tumors. Adult mice exposed to AFB1 do not get tumors and there is no increase in mutant frequency (MF) for Big Blue mice exposed as adults. That is, Lac I mutants from the AFB1- exposed adult mice showed a spontaneous mutational spectrum. Rats, however, showed a large increase in MF and, more specifically a large increase in G:C to T:A transversions (Dycaico et al., 1996). In addition, for mice there is an difference between neonata and adult mice. Neonatal mice treated with AFB1 (6 mg/kg&mdash;a dose that does result in tumors) showed an increase in cII mutation with G:C to T:A transversion as the major mutation. Adult mice treated at 6 and 60 mg/kg (doses that do not produce tumors) did not have a significant increase in cII mutation (but did give a different mutational spectrum than controls) (Chen et al. 2010)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/378","Tumorigenesis, Hepatocellular carcinoma","KE 378","The AO final key event results from the processes that occur in the earlier series of key events, which for AFB1 is a mutagenic MOA—the AFB1 induction of mutations in critical cancer genes that alter the phenotype of the mutant cell and set the stage for that cell to progress to a pre-neoplastic lesion and ultimately an HCC.  The biological processes described in this AO, however, are not specific to a mutagenic MOA—nor necessarily demonstrated for AFB1 exposure, but occur in development of HCC from all MOAs for HCC. Thus the final key events (AHF and HCC) represent the final stages of the pathway that leads to HCC from a mutagenic MOA or other MOAs. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cancer of hepatocytes, and this disease is almost always lethal in the absence of extreme intervention measures (e.g., surgery, liver transplant). A number of factors are associated with HCC including AFB1 exposure, infection with hepatitis virus (HBV), and alcohol use. A common etiologic feature of HCC, whether produced by AFB1 intoxication, HBV, cirrhosis or something else, is the presence of oxidative damage in the liver. (Ravinayagam et al., 2012 Int J Hepatol; Kim et al., 2011 J Ginseng Res).
AFB1 produces specific pro-mutagenic adducts that are believed to lead to a mutation in the p53 gene, which affects its functioning. P53 is generally considered to be a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle regulation and initiation of apoptosis. When applied in vitro to hepatocytes, AFB1 produced cellular swelling, bleb formation, and lysis. These effects may be due to lipid peroxidation affecting the cell membrane from the downstream dialdehyde metabolite of the AFB1 epoxide metabolites. (Mathijs et al., 2009, 2010) This damage is reflective of oxidative stress, a known contributor to HCC (Ravinayagam et al., 2012 Int J Hepatol; Kim et al., 2011 J Ginseng Res). As discussed elsewhere in this AOP, the Nrf2-Keap1 anti-oxidant response induced by a number of chemoprotective agents can be quite effective in preventing HCC [3-8], even in the presence of a significant burden of N7- AFB1-G adducts. 
The cellular damage produced by exposure to AFB1 likely leads to chronic inflammation, also a contributor to tumor progression. (Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al., 2004) Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) breaks down heme to bilirubin and biliverdin that have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (Keum et al., 2006; Caballero et al 2004) , thus countering the inflammatory response. The induction of HO-1 is part of the Nrf2-Keap1 anti-oxidant response.  
From a systems biology and biochemistry perspective, the presence of oxidative stress and inflammation, although not specific only to AFB1 exposure, are strong contributors to cancer progression.(Ohnishi et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2013; Higgs et al., 2014)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/381","Reduced levels of BDNF","KE 381","BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) plays a critical role in normal brain development in most vertebrates, primarily documented empirically in mammalian species. Klein et al. (2011) examined blood, serum, plasma and brain-tissue and measured BDNF levels in three different mammalian species: rat, pig, and mouse, using an ELISA method (Aid et al., 2007), whereas Trajkovska et al. 2007 determined BDNF levels in human blood.

There is compelling data that demonstrates the role  of  BDNF  in brain development for many other taxa, including fish where it acts as neurotrophic factor in controlling cell proliferation (D&#39;Angelo L et al., 2014; Heinrich and Pagtakhan, 2004) and  birds where BDNF influences development of the brain area that involved in the song control (Brenowitz 2013) and  the addition of new neurons to a cortical nucleus in adults . In the Xenopus visual system, BDNF acts as neurotrophic factor that mediates synaptic differentiation and maturation of the retinotectal circuit through cell autonomous tropomycin receptor kinase B also known as tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling on retinal ganglion cells (Sanchez et al., 2006; Marshak et al., 2007).

Biological state: BDNF belongs to a family of closely related neurotrophic factors named neurotrophins and is widely expressed in the developing and mature central nervous system (CNS). In the rodent cortex, postnatal BDNF expression is initially low but slowly increases to reach high levels around weaning. Therefore, BDNF expression peaks at a time when both structural and functional maturation of cortical circuitry occurs. During postnatal development, BDNF levels are dynamically regulated, in part by neuronal activity dependent mechanisms (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). Glutamate has been shown to increase the transcription and release of BDNF. Indeed, BDNF is synthesized, stored and released from glutamatergic neurons (Lessmann et al., 2003).

Biological compartments: BDNF initially is synthesized as precursor proteins (proBDNF), which is processed intracellularly to be transformed in its mature form (mBDNF) after proteolytically cleaved in the synaptic cleft by plasmin which is a protease activated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Cohen-Cory et al., 2010). proBDNF is constantly secreted while tPA release and mBDNF production depends on neuronal excitation (Head et al., 2009). Storage and activity-dependent release of BDNF has been demonstrated in both dendrites and axon terminals (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). More specifically, in hippocampus, BDNF appears to be stored in dendritic processes of neurons (Balkowiec and Katz, 2002). BDNF is abundant in cerebellum and cortex and has also been measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Zhang et al., 2008), whole blood, plasma, serum (plasma without clotting factors) and platelets (Trajkovska et al., 2007). BDNF has been found to be produced by astrocytes under both physiological and pathological conditions (Endo, 2005; Coco et al., 2013; Nelson and Alkon, 2014).

In humans (Pruunsild et al., 2007), mBDNF is sequestered in platelets, consequently BDNF can reach all tissues and organs. Lymphocytic cells have been shown to express BDNF in vitro similarly to eosinophils, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. The visceral and airway epithelium are also significant sources of BDNF. Female reproductive system including ovaries, placenta and uterus also express BDNF (Wessels et al., 2014).

General role in biology: The biological functions of mBDNF are mediated by binding to tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor that leads to the activation of three major intracellular signalling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K and PLC&gamma;1 (Soul&eacute; et al., 2006). TrkB-mediated signaling regulates gene transcription in the nucleus through the activation of several transcription factors. These genes are involved in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, synapse maturation and stabilization (Pang et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2005; Nelson and Alkon, 2014).

On the other hand, proBDNF binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and activates RhoA, a small GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeleton polymerization leading to inhibition of axonal elongation, growth cone collapse, and apoptosis (Dubreuil et al., 2003; Yamauchi et al., 2004; Head et al., 2009)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/382","Aberrant, Dendritic morphology","KE 382","Biological state: After becoming post-mitotic and during the differentiation process, neuronal cells undergo lengthening, branching, dendrite and dendritic spine formation (Scott and Luo, 2001). In human, dendrites appear as early as 13.5 weeks gestation in the subplate neurons while arborization begins only after 26 weeks (Mrzljak et al., 1988 and Mrzljak et al., 1990). In rodents, during the first postnatal week, both pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons go through extensive and fast dendrite growth, branching, and elaboration. Dendrite arbor's capacity and complexity continue to increase in the second and third postnatal week, however, much slower. During the same developmental window, dendritic spines begin to appear as a group. The first spines look like filopodia (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Fiala et al., 1998). Filopodia can grow and retract within seconds to minutes, permitting them to explore and identify appropriate presynaptic targets (Dailey and Smith, 1996). As dendrite spines mature, these long and thin structures change and the spines shorten and acquire a bulbous ending or ‘head’ (Dailey and Smith, 1996). At this final stage of dendrite growth, a neuron possesses a dynamic dendrite tree, which has a greater potential for connectivity and synapse creation because of dendritic spine formation. 
Biological compartments: Dendritic morphology determines many aspects of neuronal function, including action potential propagation and information processing. Postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), a protein involved in dendritic spine maturation and clustering of synaptic signalling proteins, plays a critical role in regulating dendrite outgrowth and branching, independent of its synaptic functions. In immature neurons, over-expression of PSD-95 decreases the proportion of primary dendrites that undergo additional branching, resulting in a marked reduction of secondary dendrite number. Conversely, knocking down PSD-95 protein in immature neurons increases secondary dendrite number. Binding of cypin to PSD-95 (that regulates PSD-95 location) correlates with formation of stable dendrite branches. Finally, overexpression of PSD-95 in COS-7 cells disrupts microtubule organization, indicating that PSD-95 may modulate microtubules to regulate dendritic branching. Proteins primarily involved in synaptic functions can also play developmental roles in shaping how a neuron patterns its dendrite branches (Kornau et al., 1995).
New spines containing PSDs are formed by conversion of dynamic filopodia-like spine precursors in which PSDs appeared de novo, or by direct extension of spines or spine precursors carrying preformed PSDs from the shaft. PSDs are therefore highly dynamic structures that can undergo rapid structural alteration within dendrite shafts, spines and spine precursors, permitting rapid formation and re-modelling of synaptic connections in developing CNS tissues. 
Dendritic spines are important sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in the strength of these synapses are likely to underlie important higher brain functions such as learning and memory. Spines form biochemical compartments for isolating reactions that occur at one synapse from those at other synapses thereby providing a possible way to ensure the specificity of connections between neurons in the brain.
The stages of dendrite development have been clearly described in neurons located in the developing rodent cortex and hippocampus (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Fiala et al., 1998; Redmond, 2008) and human prefrontal cortex (Mrzljak et al., 1988; Mrzljak et al., 1990).
General role in biology: Functionally, dendrites serve as post-synaptic part of a synapse, playing a critical role in the processing of information transmitted through synapses. They receive the majority of synaptic inputs comparing to the soma or the axon. Consequently, it is not surprising that postsynaptic activity is closely related to the properties of the dendritic arbor itself, implying that the dendrites strongly influence and control synaptic transmission and plasticity (Sjöström et al., 2008)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/383","Reduced, Presynaptic release of glutamate","KE 383","Biological state: Glutamate is an amino acid with neurotransmitter function that is stored in presynaptic vesicles by the action of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and under physiological conditions is found at a concentration of 100 mmol/L per vesicle. Different mechanisms are involved in the release of glutamate (reviewed in Meldrum, 2000). Glutamate is mainly released from the vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent mechanism that involves N- and P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, closely linked to vesicle docking sites. However, glutamate can also be released by reverse operation during reduction of Na+ and K+ gradient across the membrane like for example during cerebral ischemia. Interestingly, the synaptic release of glutamate is controlled by a wide range of presynaptic receptors that are not only glutamatergic like Group II and Group III of glutamate metabotropic receptors but also cholinergic such as nicotinic and muscarinic, adenosine (A1), kappa opioid, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B, cholecystokinin and neuropeptide Y (Y2) receptors.
The synaptic effects of glutamate are rapidly terminated by action of glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters [EAATs]) located on the plasma membrane of astrocytes and neurons. Therefore, pre-synaptically released glutamate is mostly transported via EAATs to astrocytes and only a small portion is re-uptaken from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic terminals(Rundfeldt et al., 1994; Blanke and VanDongen, 2009).
Following its release, glutamate exerts its effects via ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Although glutamate is available for binding to receptors for a short time, NMDA receptors show high affinity for this specific neurotransmitter that causes their activation compared to other receptors. 

Biological compartments: Glutamate is the most abundant amino acid in the diet, consequently is found at higher levels in plasma compared to cerebrospinal fluid. The blood brain barrier prevents the entry of glutamate, meaning that the glutamate present in CNS is derived from de novo synthesis of this neurotransmitter relying on the recycling of the main resources. Glutamine and α-ketoglutarate are the major precursors of glutamate. Glutamine is converted via phosphate-activated glutaminase to glutamate and ammonia, whereas α-ketoglutarate is transaminated into glutamate (Platt, 2007). In glial cells, the glutamate is metabolised via glutamine synthase into glutamine or metabolised into α-ketoglutarate. These products are actively transported out of the glial cells and back into the pre-synaptic terminals for subsequent re-synthesis and storage of glutamate. 
Five transporters of glutamate have been identified in the CNS. Two are expressed predominantly in glia and three in neurons (reviewed in Meldrum, 2000).
The presence of glutamate has also been demonstrated in other tissues and organs as glutamate receptors have been found to be expressed in pancreatic β-cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts of bones (Nedergaard et al., 2002).
General role in biology: In mature nervous system, glutamate is known to play important role in synaptic plasticity. Similarly important is this neurotransmitter during development where it regulates neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and apoptosis (reviewed in Mattson, 1996; Meldrum, 2000; Mattson, 2008).
The proper functioning of the central nervous system relays on the physiological homeostasis between glutamate and GABA, creating the opposite excitatory/inhibitory forces in the brain. Together, these two neurotransmitters constitute more than 90% of all neurotransmission. If this homeostasis is disturbed it could lead to anxiety disorders (Wieronska et al., 2015)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/385","Decrease of synaptogenesis","KE 385","Biological state: Synaptogenesis is a multi-step process that is crucial for brain development and involves the formation of synapses. It follows axonal migration, at which stage presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation occurs (Garner et al., 2002). &quot;Synaptic assembly&quot; that refers to the gathering of the appropriate components and &quot;synaptic formation&quot; that is defined by the mechanisms involved in recruitment of molecules required for differentiation, stabilization and maturation of synapse, are the main phases that characterise synaptogenesis (Col&oacute;n-Ramos, 2009). Elimination is a physiological step involved in synaptogenesis regarding the synapses that fail to get stabilised and mature.

The first step is the recognition and the establishment of contact between an axon and a dendritic spine in which pre- and postsynaptic neurons play important role. The presynaptic differentiation occurs followed by excretion of neurotransmitters that bind to appropriate receptors located on the target spine. However, a postsynaptic neuron does not passively receive guidance from a presynaptic axon but are the same dendritic filopodia that gradually are transformed into spines that select and engage their presynaptic neurons. The transformation of dendritic filopodia into dendritic spines that involves the expression of the whole postsynaptic machinery such as postsynaptic density (PSD), receptor subunits, scaffolding proteins and actin cytoskeleton, is the first step to give nascent synapses. However, to become functional and mature these synapses need an important number of cell-cell interactions, including stimulation from glutamatergic synapses as well as the influence of neurotrophic factors (Munno and Syed, 2003).

However, all this is true for glutamatergic synapses because GABAergic synapses do not appear in dendritic spines, but rather form on dendritic shafts, nerve cell somata and axon initial segments. These inhibitory synapses besides their distinct location are also structurally different compared to excitatory synapses (reviewed in Gatto and Broadie, 2010).


Biological compartments: Synaptogenesis is spatially and temporally strictly controlled process. It does not happen in a uniform way in all brain regions and there important differences between the times of appearance of the main two types of synapses (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). For example, in rat hippocampus excitatory synapses are well established or fully mature within the two first postnatal weeks, whereas inhibitory synapses cannot be found prior to PND 18, after which it increases steadily to reach adult levels at PND 28. In addition, in rat neostriatal neurons the excitatory responses to both cortical and thalamic stimuli can be observed by PND 6, but the long-lasting hyperpolarization and late depolarization is never seen before PND 12.

Structural remodelling of synapses and formation of new synaptic contacts has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of plasticity which is involved in learning and memory. LTP induction results in a sequence of morphological changes consisting of a transient remodelling of the postsynaptic membrane followed by a marked increase in the proportion of axon terminals contacting two or more dendritic spines. Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that these spines arose from the same dendrite. As pharmacological blockade of LTP prevented these morphological changes, it is suggested that LTP is associated with the formation of new, mature and probably functional synapses contacting the same presynaptic terminal and thereby duplicating activated synapses (Erik et al., 2006).

In human, synaptogenesis does not happen at the same time in all brain regions, as the prefrontal cortex lags behind in terms of synapse formation compared to the auditory and visual cortices. In contrast, synaptogenesis appears to proceed concurrently in different brain areas for rhesus monkey (Erecinska et al., 2004).


General role in biology: The period of rapid synaptogenesis or the so-called brain growth spurt is considered one of the most important processes that take place during brain development (Garner et al., 2002). This process is crucial not only in neurodevelopment but also plays a vital role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory and adaptation throughout life. Without this process no complex brain network can be established as synapse is the fundamental unit of connectivity and communication between neurons (Tau and Peterson, 2010). Cell adhesion represents the most direct way of coordinating synaptic connectivity in the brain. Recent evidence highlights the importance of a trans-synaptic interaction between postsynaptic neuroligins and presynaptic neurexins. These transmembrane molecules bind each other extracellularly to promote adhesion between dendrites and axons, facilitating synapse establishment (Dean and Dresbach, 2006). Furthermore, the number of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses created at single neuron dictates neuronal excitability and function (Schummers et al., 2002)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/386","Decrease of neuronal network function","KE 386","Biological state: There are striking differences in neuronal network formation and function among the developing and mature brain. The developing brain shows a slow maturation and a transient passage from spontaneous, long-duration action potentials to synaptically-triggered, short-duration action potentials.

Furthermore, at this precise developmental stage the neuronal network is characterised by &quot;hyperexcitability&rdquo;, which is related to the increased number of local circuit recurrent excitatory synapses and the lack of &gamma;-amino-butyric acid A (GABAA)-mediated inhibitory function that appears much later. This &ldquo;hyperexcitability&rdquo; disappears with maturation when pairing of the pre- and postsynaptic partners occurs and synapses are formed generating population of postsynaptic potentials and population of spikes followed by developmental GABA switch. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is dominant at early stages of development and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents are far more times longer than those in maturation, allowing more calcium to enter the neurons. The processes that are involved in increased calcium influx and the subsequent intracellular events seem to play a critical role in establishment of wiring of neural circuits and strengthening of synaptic connections during development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Neurons that do not receive glutaminergic stimulation are undergoing developmental apoptosis.

During the neonatal period, the brain is subject to profound alterations in neuronal circuitry due to high levels of synaptogenesis and gliogenesis. For example, in neuroendocrine regions such as the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (POA-AH), the site of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) system is developmentally regulated by glutamatergic neurons. The changes in the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B system begin early in postnatal development, before the onset of puberty, thereby playing a role in establishing the appropriate environment for the subsequent maturation of GnRH neurons (Adams et al., 1999).

Biological compartments: Neural network formation and function happen in all brain regions but it appears to onset at different time points of development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Glutamatergic neurotransmission in hippocampus is poorly developed at birth. Initially, NMDA receptors play important role but the vast majority of these premature glutamatergic synapses are &ldquo;silent&rdquo; possibly due to delayed development of hippocampal AMPA receptors. In contrast, in the cerebral cortex the maturation of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission happens much earlier. The &ldquo;silent&rdquo; synapses disappear by PND 7-8 in both brain regions mentioned above.

There is strong evidence suggesting that NMDA receptor subunit composition controls synaptogenesis and synapse stabilization (Gambrill and Barria, 2011). It is established fact that during early postnatal development in the rat hippocampus, synaptogenesis occurs in parallel with a developmental switch in the subunit composition of NMDA receptors from NR2B to NR2A. It is suggested that early expression of NR2A in organotypic hippocampal slices reduces the number of synapses and the volume and dynamics of spines. In contrast, overexpression of NR2B does not affect the normal number and growth of synapses. However, it does increase spine motility, adding and retracting spines at a higher rate. The C terminus of NR2B, and specifically its ability to bind CaMKII, is sufficient to allow proper synapse formation and maturation. Conversely, the C terminus of NR2A was sufficient to stop the development of synapse number and spine growth. These results indicate that the ratio of synaptic NR2B over NR2A controls spine motility and synaptogenesis, and suggest a structural role for the intracellular C terminus of NR2 in recruiting the signalling and scaffolding molecules necessary for proper synaptogenesis. Interestingly, it was found that genetic deletion of NR3A accelerates glutamatergic synaptic transmission, as measured by AMPAR-mediated postsynaptic currents recorded in hippocampal CA1. Consistent, the deletion of NR3A accelerates the expression of the glutamate receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and GluR1 sugesting that glutamatergic synapse maturation is critically dependent upon activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (Henson et al., 2012).

General role in biology: The development of neuronal networks can be distinguished into two phases: an early &lsquo;establishment&rsquo; phase of neuronal connections, where activity-dependent and independent mechanisms could operate, and a later &lsquo;maintenance&rsquo; phase, which appears to be controlled by neuronal activity (Yuste and Sur, 1999). These neuronal networks facilitate information flow that is necessary to produce complex behaviors, including learning and memory (Mayford et al., 2012)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/396","Covalent Binding, Protein","KE 396","The molecular initiating event is covalent binding of electrophilic chemical species with selected nucleophilic molecular sites of action in proteins generating immunogenic neoantigens through a process termed haptenisation[1];[2]. In contrast to receptor-mediated chemical interactions electrophiles are not specific with regard to their molecular target. Moreover, some chemicals are able to react with several different nucleophilic chemical substituents. Therefore, the identification of the specific target protein is not considered to be critical. Moreover, it is recognized that reactivity measured with a particular nucleophilic target or model nucleophile does not necessarily reflect a specific chemical reaction, as many reactions target the same chemical substituent[3]. For toxicological endpoints for which protein binding is important, the biological nucleophile is assumed to be selected amino acids. The exact extent of adduct formation to each amino acid is dependent on the relative hardness / softness of the electrophile and nucleophile[3]. The inability to identify the exact biological nucleophile is deemed less important than information regarding the electrophile. As noted in the hard-soft acid base theory, a soft electrophile will have a relative preference for a soft nucleophile; while a hard electrophile will have a relative preference for a hard nucleophile. As a consequence, for a series of electrophiles assigned to the same mechanistic cluster within a particular domain, the relative rates of reactivity between each electrophile and any nucleophile will remain the same. In other words, while absolute reactivity may vary with protocols, relative reactivity will usually not vary significantly[3]. Binding experiments with small model nucleophiles reveal that, within a particular reaction within a mechanism, the rate of reactivity varies markedly. Moreover, while some compounds appear to bind exclusively with thiol or amine, others bind to a variety of nucleophiles. However, an electrophile is most likely to exhibit a preference for a particular nucleophile. In more complex systems, nucleophilic target preferences may be masked by other factors. It is self-evident that the number of cysteine and lysine residues within a protein will impact target probability. For example, for serum albumin, a major serum protein, 10% of the amino acid residues are lysine but albumin has very few free cysteine residues. Also, it is self-evident that a target site (e.g. cysteine or lysine) which is located on an exposed surface of a protein is more likely to react with an electrophile than one that is located within a grove or fold of a protein. Such steric constraints are imposed by the primary structure (i.e. amino acid sequence) of the peptide or protein, as well as the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins imposed by disulfide bridges, and folding and coiling. Similarly, the microenvironment of the reaction site (e.g. hydrophilic versus hydrophobic) may affect the probability of a particular reaction. Free cysteine residues are more abundant in proteins in the aqueous cytosol than in the non- aqueous biomembranes [4]. An ancillary event in identifying protein-binding is metabolism and/or abiotic transformation (e.g. autoxidation)[5]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/398","Activation, Dendritic Cells","KE 398","Immature epidermal dendritic cells, known as Langerhans cells, and dermal dendritic cells serve as antigen-presenting cells ([1];[2];[3];[4]). In this role, they recognize and internalize the hapten-protein complex formed during covalent binding leading to their activation. Subsequently, the dendritic cell loses its ability to seize new hapten-protein complexes and gains the potential to display the allergen-MHC-complex to naive T-cells; this process is often referred to as dendritic cell maturation. Simultaneously, under the influence of fibroblast- blood endothelial- and lymph endothelial chemokines (e.g. CCL19, CCL21) and epidermal cytokines (e.g. interleukin (IL), IL-1 &alpha;, IL-1&beta;, IL-18, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;)) maturing dendritic cells migrate from the epidermis to the dermis of the skin and then to the proximal lymph nodes, where they can present the hapten-protein complex to T-cells via a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule ([5];[6]). Dendritic cell activation, upon exposure to hapten-protein complexes also leads to functional changes in the cells. For example, there are changes in chemokine secretion, cytokine secretion and in the expression of chemokine receptors (see[3]). Additionally, during dendritic cell maturation MHC, co-stimulatory and intercellular adhesion molecules (e.g. CD40, CD86, and DC11 and CD54, respectively) are up-regulated (see[3];[4];[7]). Signal transduction cascades precede changes in expression of surface proteins markers and chemokine or cytokine secretion. In fact, there is evidence that during the response, hapten-protein complexes can react with cell surface proteins and activate mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway. In particular, the biochemical pathway involving extracellulare signal-regulating kinases- the c-jun N-terminal kinases and the p38 kinases have been shown to be activated upon exposure to protein-binding chemicals[8]. These pathways are of particular importance in keratinocytes and dendritic cell response to protein-hapten complexes. Components of signal transduction pathways are kinases, which phosphorylate and dephosphorylate a variety of substrates in order to elicit a change in the expression or secretion of target molecules. As a result, components of the signal transduction cascade are thought to be biomarkers[9]. Investigations into the possible role of calcium influx as an early event in dendritic cell activation suggest that calcium influx is a second event following reactive oxygen species induction[10];[11]."

Among the many brain areas engaged in the acquisition or retrieval of a learned event, the hippocampal-based memory systems have received the most study. The main learning areas and pathways are similar in rodents and primates, including man (Eichenbaum, 2000; Stanton and Spear, 1990; Squire, 2004; Gilbert., 2006). 

In humans, the hippocampus is involved in recollection of an event&rsquo;s rich spatial-temporal contexts and distinguished from simple semantic memory which is memory of a list of facts (Burgess et al., 2000). Hemispheric specialization has occurred in humans, with the left hippocampus specializing in verbal and narrative memories (i.e., context-dependent episodic or autobiographical memory) and the right hippocampus, more prominently engaged in visuo-spatial memory (i.e., memory for locations within an environment). The hippocampus is particularly critical for the formation of episodic memory, and autobiographical memory tasks have been developed to specifically probe these functions (Eichenbaun, 2000; Willoughby et al., 2014). In rodents, there is obviously no verbal component in hippocampal memory, but reliance on the hippocampus for spatial, temporal and contextual memory function has been well documented. Spatial memory deficits and fear-based context learning paradigms engage the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (Eichenbaum, 2000; Shors et al., 2001; Samuels et al., 2011; Vorhees and Williams, 2014; D&rsquo;Hooge and DeDeyn, 2001; Lynch, 2004; O&rsquo;Keefe and Nadal, 1978).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/405","irregularities, ovarian cycle","KE 405","Biological state
The female ovarian cycle is the result of a balanced cooperation between several organs and is determined by a complex interaction of hormones. Ovarian cycle irregularities include disturbances in the ovarian cycle (e.g. longer cycle, persistent estrus) and/or ovulation problems (deferred ovulation or anovulation). 
The estrous cycle (also oestrous cycle) comprises the recurring physiologic changes that are induced by reproductive hormones in females. Estrous cycles start after sexual maturity in females and are interrupted by anestrous phases or pregnancies. During this cycle numerous well defined and sequential alterations in reproductive tract histology, physiology and cytology occur, initiated and regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The central feature of the mammalian estrous cycle is the periodic maturation of eggs that will be released at ovulation and luteinisation of the follicles after ovulation to form corpora lutea.
Adapted from www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/43754807.pdf

Biological compartments
The cyclic changes that occur in the female reproductive tract are initiated and regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Although folliculogenesis occurs independently of hormonal stimulation up until the formation of early tertiary follicles, the gonadotrophins luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are essential for the completion of follicular maturation and development of mature preovulatory (Graafian) follicles. 
The oestrous cycle consists of four stages: prooestrus, oestrus, metoestrus (or dioestrus 1) and dioestrus (or dioestrus 2) orchestrated by hormones.
Levels of LH and FSH begin to increase just after dioestrus. Both hormones are secreted by the same secretory cells (gonadotrophs) in the pars distalis of the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis). FSH stimulates the development of the zona granulosa and triggers expression of LH receptors by granulosa cells. LH initiates the synthesis and secretion of androstenedione and, to a lesser extent, testosterone by the theca interna; these androgens are utilised by granulosa cells as substrates in the synthesis of estrogen. Pituitary release of gonadotrophins thus drives follicular maturation and secretion of estrogen during prooestrus.
Gonadotrophin secretion by the anterior pituitary is regulated by luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), produced by the hypothalamus. LHRH is transported along the axons of hypothalamic neurones to the median eminence where it is secreted into the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system and transported to the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus secretes LHRH in rhythmic pulses; this pulsatility is essential for the normal activation of gonadotrophs and subsequent release of LH and FSH. 
Adapted from www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/43754807.pdf
Follicles that produce estrogens have sequestered pituitary FSH which in turn stimulates the aromatase reaction. Such follicles can undergo normal development and ovulation and contain eggs that readily resume meiosis when released. In the absence of an active local aromatase (i.e., no follicle-stimulating hormone), the follicles and oocytes become atretic and regress without ovulating. If aromatase is present, the estrogen and follicle stimulating hormone can further develop the follicular cells for normal luteal function after ovulation takes place (Ryan, 1982).
General role in biology
A sequential progression of interrelated physiological and behavioural cycles underlines the female's successful production of young. In many but not all species the first and most basic of these is estrous cycle, which is itself a combination of cycles."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/408","reduction in ovarian granulosa cells, Aromatase (Cyp19a1)","KE 408","Biological state

Aromatase (Cyp19a1, estrogen synthetase, estrogen synthase) is an enzyme responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of estrogens, in particular it is responsible for conversion of C-19 androgens into C-18 estrogens (E R Simpson et al., 1994), (Ryan, 1982). It is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (Ryan, 1982). The aromatase gene uses multiple promoters in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in a tissue-specific regulation of aromatase activity (Evan R Simpson, 2004). The cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway is considered to be the primary signalling cascade through which the gonadal Cyp19 promoter is regulated (Stocco, 2008).

Biological compartments

Aromatase in the specialized cells of the ovary, hypothalamus, and placenta has a crucial role in reproduction for mammalian and other vertebrates by converting androgens to estrogens. This enzyme is also present in various other tissues, such as skin, fat, bone marrow, liver, adrenals, and testes (Ryan, 1982).

General role in biology

The ovarian aromatase produces systemic and locally acting estrogens for general reproductive functions. The systemic estrogen produced by ovarian aromatase modulates the central nervous system and pituitary functions for the ovarian cycle and in spontaneously ovulating mammals it triggers the release of the ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (Ryan, 1982), (Hillier, 1985). Because only a single gene (CYP19) encodes aromatase in humans, targeted disruption of this gene or inhibition of its product effectively eliminates estrogen biosynthesis (Evan R Simpson et al., 2002). Much attention has been given to the regulation of the aromatase gene and its implication in the development and progression of human estrogen-dependent diseases, including breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and endometriosis, see review (Bulun et al., 2005)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/409","Metabolism of AFB1, Production of Reactive Electrophiles","KE 409","The reactive exo-epoxide is formed in hepatocytes (or extra-hepatically) by metabolism of the parent AFB1 by CYP450 (Larsson et al., 1990; Larsson and Tjalve, 1993). The reactive metabolite then escapes the endoplasmic reticulum where the CYP450 is located. The reactive metabolite must evade conjugation with GSH in the cytoplasm or binding with other cytoplasmic nucleophiles. It then traverses the nuclear membrane in order to reach the cell nucleus and the nuclear DNA. Once the reactive metabolite is in the cell nucleus, binding to nuclear DNA and the formation of DNA adducts can occur.

Biological Process: Production of Reactive Electrophiles

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) can be oxidized to a variety of metabolites, many of which can be further metabolized, for example by conjugation with glutathione (GSH) via Glutathione-S-transferase (GST). In order for DNA binding and formation of a pro-mutagenic DNA adduct to occur, AFB1 must be metabolized via Cytochrome P450 metabolism to a specific highly reactive form of AFB1, the exo-epoxide AFB1-8,9-epoxide. CYP3A4 forms the exo-form of this reactive epoxide only. CYP1A2, inducible in liver, forms both the exo- and the endo-epoxides; in human liver, CYP1A2 metabolism occurs with a lower Vmax (enzymatic rate) and higher Km (half-maximal concentrations) than CYP3A4 (Degen and Neumann,1981; Groopman and Kensler, 2005; Guengerich et al., 1996; Ueng et al., 1995). Figure 1, from Pottenger et al., 2014, depicts the metabolism of AFB1.

Metabolic activation of AFB1 occurs mainly in the liver, where the highest levels of the CYP isozymes are located. Competitive metabolism with other hepatic and extra-hepatic P450 isozymes may decrease the proportion of the specific metabolite, AFB1-8,9-epoxide; this can reduce the effectiveness of hepatic activation of AFB1. Alternatively, induction of either hepatic or extra-hepatic GST activity can reduce the levels of AFB1-epoxide available for reaction with DNA by increasing conjugation of the epoxide with GSH. This conjugation renders the epoxide inactive and directs it towards eventual elimination (Guengerich et al., 1996).






Figure 1. Metabolism of AFB1,



Figure 1 was obtained from Pottenger et al., 2014.

The AFB1 pro-mutagenic DNA adduct is most likely the 8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 adduct, or N7-AFB1-G (Croy et al., 1978). Once the exo-epoxide is bound to the N7-guanine, it is subject to ring-opening to form the more highly pro-mutagenic 8,9-dihydro-8-(2,6-diamino-4-oxo-3,4-pyrimid-9-yl-foramido)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1; this is known as the formamidopyrimidine adduct or AFB1-FAPy adduct (Brown et al., 2006).

The reactive exo-epoxide is formed in hepatocytes (or extra-hepatically) by metabolism of the parent AFB1 by CYP450 (Larsson et al., 1990; Larsson and Tjalve, 1993). The reactive metabolite then escapes the endoplasmic reticulum where the CYP450 is located. The reactive metabolite must evade conjugation with GSH in the cytoplasm or binding with other cytoplasmic nucleophiles. It then traverses the nuclear membrane in order to reach the cell nucleus and the nuclear DNA. Once the reactive metabolite is in the cell nucleus, binding to nuclear DNA and the formation of DNA adducts can occur.

Level of Biological Organization : Molecular

Metabolic activation of AFB1 occurs at the intracellular level, with sub-cellular organelles involved due to the localization of CYP450 in the endoplasmic reticulum, coupled with the epoxide hydratase; GST is localized in the cytosol (Guengerich et al., 1996). Organ architecture also plays a role, as the structure of the liver is orientated around the O2 gradient set by the portal artery and hepatic vein; hepatocytes nearest the portal artery demonstrate increased tissue oxygen while those around the portal vein have decreased tissue O2 and correspondingly higher levels of CYP450 activity.

Evidence for Chemical Initiation of this Initial Molecular Event

Pre-MIE: There is an extensive database on AFB1 in many different systems demonstrating formation of the AFB1 exo-epoxide. This database includes several mammalian species (humans, non-human primates, rats, mice) in addition to birds (turkeys) and fish (Eaton and Gallagher, 1994; IARC, 1993).

Evidence Supporting Essentiality

Pre-MIE

Strong

Many studies show that in the absence of AFB1 metabolic activation, tumors do not occur. Treatment of rats with the CYP450-inhibitor and GST-inducer oltipraz reduces the levels of AFB1 DNA adducts by 65-70%, and the later-forming altered hepatic foci (AHF) and liver tumors are also reduced by 97 and 100%, respectively; thus, no hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) form in the oltipraz-treated rats dosed with AFB1 (Roebuck et al., 1991). More recent data show even more effective prevention of tumors and of hepatic foci in rats pre-treated with a triterpenoid, 1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole (CDDO-Im) (Johnson et al., 2014). The pre-treated rats were reported with a 70% reduction of AFB1-induced adducts in urine but had 100% inhibition of tumors, and only 1 rat out of 23 pre-treated had any altered hepatic foci (AHF). There are similar data in humans treated with oltipraz. Kensler et al. (1998) report a significant reduction in a biomarker of exposure AFB1-induced albumin adducts, supporting the human relevance of this metabolic activation

Another line of evidence for essentiality of the pre-MIE is the recognized difference in sensitivity to AFB1-induced liver tumors between mice and rats (Degen and Neumann, 1981). Mice, have considerably increased metabolic activation of AFB1 to the exo-epoxide compared to rats; mice are nonetheless much less sensitive to AFB1-induced liver tumors. It is thought that this difference is due to the constitutive presence of GST-alpha activity in mice vs rats, where this activity is not found."

Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in humans and other vertebrates. 
Biological compartments
In humans and other mammals, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females and other steroidogenic tissues (e.g., brain, adipose). It either acts locally /or is transported to other tissues via blood circulation. Testosterone synthesis takes place within the mitochondria of Leydig cells, the testosterone-producing cells of the testis. It is produced upon stimulation of these cells by Luteinizing hormone (LH) that is secreted in pulses into the peripheral circulation by the pituitary gland in response to Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Testosterone and its aromatized product, estradiol, feed back to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to suppress transiently LH and thus testosterone production. In response to reduced testosterone levels, GnRH and LH are produced. This negative feedback cycle results in pulsatile secretion of LH followed by pulsatile production of testosterone (Ellis, Desjardins, and Fraser 1983), (Chandrashekar and Bartke 1998).
General role in biology
Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. Male sexual differentiation depends on testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the expression of androgen receptors by target cells (Manson and Carr 2003). During the development secretion of androgens by Leydig cells is essential for masculinization of the foetus (Nef 2000). 
The foetal Leydig cells develop in utero. These cells become competent to produce testosterone in rat  by gestational day (GD) 15.5, with increasing production thereafter. Peak steroidogenic activity is reached just prior to birth, on GD19 (Chen, Ge, and Zirkin 2009). Testosterone secreted by foetal Leydig cells is required for the differentiation of the male urogenital system late in gestation (Huhtaniemi and Pelliniemi 1992). Foetal Leydig cells also play a role in the scrotal descent of the testis through their synthesis of insulin-like growth factor 3 (Insl3), for review see (Nef 2000).
In humans, the first morphological sign of testicular differentiation is the formation of testicular cords, which can be seen between 6 and 7 weeks of gestation. Steroid-secreting Leydig cells can be seen in the testis at 8 weeks of gestation. At this period, the concentration of androgens in the testicular tissue and blood starts to rise, peaking at 14-16 weeks of gestation. This increase comes with an increase in the number of Leydig cells for review see (Rouiller-Fabre et al. 2009).
Adult Leydig cells, which are distinct from the foetal Leydig cells, form during puberty and supply the testosterone required for the onset of spermatogenesis, among other functions. Distinct stages of adult Leydig cell development have been identified and characterized. The stem Leydig cells are undifferentiated cells that are capable of indefinite self-renewal but also of differentiation to steroidogenic cells. These cells give rise to progenitor Leydig cells,  which proliferate, continue to differentiate, and give rise to the immature Leydig cells. Immature Leydig cells synthesize high levels of testosterone metabolites and develop into  terminally differentiated adult Leydig cells, which  produce high levels of testosterone. With aging, both serum and testicular testosterone concentrations progressively decline, for review see (Nef 2000).
Androgens play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of male reproductive and sexual functions.
Low levels of circulating androgens can cause disturbances in male sexual development, resulting in congenital
abnormalities of the male reproductive tract. Later in life, this may cause reduced fertility, sexual dysfunction,
decreased muscle formation and bone mineralisation, disturbances of fat metabolism, and cognitive
dysfunction. Testosterone levels decrease as a process of ageing: signs and symptoms caused by this decline
can be considered a normal part of ageing."

Overview for Molecular Initiating Event

Thyroid Disrupting Chemicals (TDCs) are defined as the xenobiotics that interfere with the thyroid axis with different outcomes for the organism. A very well-studied mechanism of action of the TDCs is the reduction of the circulating levels of THs by inhibiting hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland. For example, perchlorate is a very potent inhibitor of iodide uptake through the sodium/iodide symporter (Tonacchera et al., 2004). Perchlorate has been detected in human breast milk ranging from 1.4 to 92.2 mg &mu;l&ndash;1 (10.5 &mu;g l&ndash;1 mean) in 18 US states (Kirk et al. 2005), and 1.3 to 411 &mu;g l&ndash;1 (9.1 &mu;g l&ndash;1 median) in the Boston area, United States (Pearce et al. 2007). Perchlorate has also been detected in human colostrum of 46 women in the Boston area (from &lt; 0.05 to 187.2 &mu;mol l&ndash;1 (Leung et al. 2009)). The mechanism of perchlorate action is quite simple, as it is believed to be mediated only by the NIS inhibition (Dohan et al., 2007; Wolff, 1998). Additionally, thiocyanate and nitrate are two known inhibitors that have been found to reduce circulating TH levels (Blount et al., 2006; Steinhaus et al., 2007), but they are both less potent than perchlorate (Tonacchera et al., 2004). However, there are also contradictory results from other studies that showed no correlation between thyroid parameters and perchlorate levels in humans (Pearce et al., 2010; Amitai et al., 2007; Tellez et al., 2005).

Co-occurrence of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate can alter thyroid function in pregnant women. Horton et al. (2015) have shown positive associations between the weighted sum of urinary concentrations of these three analytes and increased TSH, with perchlorate showing the largest weight in the index. Interestingly, De Groef et al. 2006 showed that nitrate and thiocyanate, acquired through drinking water or food, account for a much larger proportion of iodine uptake inhibition than perchlorate, suggesting that NIS inhibition and any potential downstream effect by perchlorate are highly dependent on the presence of other environmental NIS inhibitors and iodine intake itself (Leung et al., 2010). In particular, Tonacchera et al. (2004) showed that the relative potency of perchlorate to inhibit radioactive I&minus; uptake by NIS is 15, 30 and 240 times that of thiocyanate, iodide, and nitrate respectively on a molar concentration basis. These data are in line with earlier studies in rats (Alexander and Wolff, 1996; Greer et al. 1966). Contradictory findings in these studies may therefore be a result of the confounding mixtures in the environment, masking the primary effect of perchlorate.

Decreased iodine intake can decrease TH production, and therefore exposure to perchlorate might be particularly detrimental in iodine-deficient individuals (Leung et al. 2010). Moreover, biologically based dose-response modeling of the relationships among iodide status (e.g., dietary iodine levels), perchlorate dose, and TH production in pregnant women has shown that iodide intake has a profound effect on the likelihood that exposure to goitrogens will produce hypothyroxinemia (Lewandowski et al. 2015).

During pregnancy TH requirements increase, particularly during the first trimester (Alexander et al. 2004; Leung et al. 2010), due to higher concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, placental T4 inner-ring deiodination leading to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), and transfer of small amounts of T4 to the foetus (during the first trimester foetal thyroid function is absent). Moreover, glomerular filtration rate and clearance of proteins and other molecules are both increased during pregnancy, possibly causing increased renal iodide clearance and a decreased of circulating plasma iodine (Glinoer, 1997). Thus, even though the foetal thyroid can trap iodide by about 12 week of gestation (Fisher and Klein, 1981), high concentrations of maternal perchlorate may potentially decrease thyroidal iodine available to the foetus by inhibiting placental NIS (Leung et al. 2010).

Consequences of TH deficiency depend on the developmental timing of the deficiency (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). For instance, if the TH deficiency occurs during early pregnancy, offspring show visual attention, visual processing and gross motor skills deficits, while if it occurs later, offspring may show subnormal visual and visuospatial skills, along with slower response speeds and motor deficits. If TH insufficiency occurs after birth, language and memory skills are most predominantly affected (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004).

Along this line, age and developmental stage are crucial in determining sensitivity to NIS inhibitors (e.g., perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate). In this regard, McMullen et al. (2017) have shown that adolescent boys and girls, more than adults, represent vulnerable subpopulations to NIS symporter inhibitors. Altogether these studies indicate that age, gender, developmental stage, and dietary iodine levels can affect the impact of NIS inhibitors.

Finally, ten more small simple-structured molecules were identified in a large screening study (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b) that could block iodide uptake by specifically disrupting NIS in a dose-dependent manner. These molecules were named Iodide Transport Blockers (ITBs). There are few organic molecules that lead to NIS inhibition but no direct interaction with NIS has been determined (Gerard et al., 1994; Kaminsky et al., 1991, Lindenthal et al., 2009). Up to date, only dysidenin, a toxin isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea herbacea, has been reported to specifically inhibit NIS (Van Sande et al., 2003). Finally, the aryltrifluoroborates were found to inhibit iodide uptake with an IC50 value of 0.4 &mu;M on rat-derived thyroid cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). The biological activity is rationalized by the presence of the BF3&minus; ion as a minimal binding motif for substrate recognition at the iodide binding site.

It has been also shown that many anions, such as ClO3-, SCN-, NO3-, ReO4-, TcO4- and in a lower extent Br- and BF4-, are also acting as NIS substrates and they enter the cell by the same transporter mechanism (Van Sande et al., 2003). It has been also shown that ClO4- is transferred by NIS with high affinity and is considered as one of its most potent inhibitors (Dohan et al., 2007). Most recently, the aryltrifluoroborates were also shown to inhibit NIS function (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). A library of 17,020 compounds was tested by a radioactive screening method with high specificity using transfected mammalian cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b; 2007) for NIS inhibition evaluation. Further studies with the most powerful iodide transport blockers showed a high diversity in their structure and mode of action (Lindenthal et al., 2009).

Apart from the human, functional NIS protein has been also identified in different species, including the rat (Dai et al., 1996), the mouse (Perron et al., 2001), the pig (Selmi-Ruby et al., 2003), zebrafish (Thienpont et al., 2011) and xenopus (amphibian) (Lindenthal et al., 2009). Mouse and rat NIS proteins contain 618 amino acid residues, while the human and pig variants contain 643. There are several NIS variants that produce three active proteins in the pig due to alternative splicing at mRNA sites that are not present on the other species (Selmi-Ruby et al., 2003).

NIS orthologs are discussed in the review by Darrouzet&#39;s group (Darrouzet et al., 2014). Interestingly, functional differences have been identified between mouse or rat NIS (mNIS or rNIS, respectively) and human NIS (hNIS). The rat and themouse orthologs were shown to accumulate radioisotopes more efficiently than the human protein (Dayem et al., 2008; Heltemes et al., 2003). The molecular basis of these functional differences could be helpful for further characterization of NIS. Zhang and collaborators showed that rNIS is localized in a higher proportion at the plasma membrane than hNIS and the N-terminal region up to putative transmembrane helix TM7 appears to be involved in this difference (Zhang et al., 2005). These authors also reported differences in the kinetics of the Na+ binding, implicating the region spanning from TM4 to TM6 and Ser200 of hNIS. They, thus, proposed that this region could be involved in sodium binding (Zhang et al., 2005). In our laboratory, it was shown that the Vmax of the mouse protein is four times higher than the Vmax of the human protein when expressed in the same cell line (HEK-293) (Dayem et al., 2008; Darrouzet et al., 2014). The KmI value determined for hNIS (9.0 &plusmn; 0.8 &mu;M) was significantly lower than the KmI for the mouse protein (26.4 &plusmn; 3.5 &mu;M) whereas the KmNa values were not significantly different indicating that mNIS has a lower iodide affinity than hNIS. Similarly to the rat protein, mNIS is predominantly localized in the plasma membrane whereas the human ortholog is detected intracellularly in 40% of the cells in which it is expressed (Darrouzet et al., 2014). However, the difference in the Vmax values does not only seem to be related to the higher intracellular localization of hNIS. Using chimeric proteins between human and mouse NIS, we showed that the N-terminal region up to TM8 is most probably involved in iodide binding, and that the region from TM5 to the C terminus could play an important role in targeting the protein to the plasma membrane (Dayem et al., 2008). One of the long-term goals of these studies is the engineering of a chimeric NIS protein most suitable for gene therapy, i.e. preserving regions responsible for the high turnover rate and the efficient plasma membrane localization of the mouse proteinwhile replacing the immunogenic extracellular regions with those of the human ortholog. The porcine NIS gene gives rise to splice variants leading to three active NIS proteins with differences in their C-terminal extremities [4]. However, it is not known if these differences lead to distinct properties (Darrouzet et al., 2014).

There is evidence that the MIE (NIS inhibition) is of relevance also for fish as an expression of the slc5a5 transcript (sodium/iodide co-transporter) has been described by various publications for the zebrafish embryo (see www.zfin.org). It has been demonstrated that NIS inhibitors in zebra fish lead also to a strong repression of thyroid hormone levels (Thienpont et al., 2011) and in xenopus (amphibian) to  inhibition of the iodide-induced current  (Lindenthal et al., 2009).

Biological state: Sodium/Iodide symporter (NIS) is a key protein in the thyroid function and its role has been thoroughly investigated after the determination of its molecular identity a few decades ago (Dai et al., 1996). NIS is an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein and it belongs to the superfamily of sodium /solute symporters (SSS) and to the family of human transporters SLC5 (De La Vieja, 2000; Jung, 2002). Its molecular weight is 87 kDa and it contains 13 transmembrane domains that transport 2 sodium cations (Na+) for each iodide anion (I-) into the follicular thyroid cell (Dohan et al., 2003). The regulation of NIS protein function is usually cell- and tissue-specific (Hingorani et al., 2010) and it is done at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, including epigenetic regulation (Darrouzet et al., 2014; Russo et al., 2011a). One of the major NIS regulators is the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which has been shown to enhance NIS mRNA and protein expression, therefore it can contribute to restore and maintain iodide uptake activity (Saito et al., 1997; Kogai et al., 2000). At the posttranslational level TSH also contributes to NIS regulation but the specific mechanisms that underlie these effects are still under investigation (Riedel et al., 2001).

Biological compartments: NIS protein is mainly found at the basolateral plasma membrane of the thyroid follicular cells (Dai et al., 1996), where it actively mediates the accumulation of iodide that is the main component of thyroid hormone synthesis and therefore is considered as a major regulator of thyroid homeostasis. NIS also mediates active I- transport in extrathyroidal tissues but it is commonly agreed that is regulated and processed differently in each tissue. Functional NIS protein has been found in salivary gland ductal cells (Jhiang et al., 1998; La Perle et al., 2013), in the mammary gland during lactation (Perron et al., 2001; Cho et al., 2000), lung epithelial cells (Fragoso et la., 2004), intestinal enterocytes (Nicola et al., 2009), stomach cells (Kotani et al., 1998), placenta (Bidart et al., 2000) and testicular cells (Russo et al. 2011b). Additionally, contradictory results have been obtained regarding the NIS expression in human kidney tissue (Lacroix et al., 2001; Spitzweg et al., 2001). In the case of the lactating breast, it is suggested that NIS serves the transfer of iodide in the cells and its subsequent accumulation in the milk, thereby supplying newborns with this component during this sensitive developmental period (Tazebay et al., 2000). Additionally, NIS mRNA has been detected in various other tissues, such as colon, ovaries, uterus, and spleen (Perron et al., 2001; Spitzweg et al., 1998; Vayre et al., 1999), but the functional NIS protein and the site of its localization has not been verified.

General role in biology: The NIS is known in the field of thyroidology because of its ability to mediate the active transport of I- into the thyrocytes, which is the first and most crucial step for T3 and T4 biosynthesis (Dohan et al., 2000). NIS is located on the basolateral membrane of the thyrocytes and co-transports 2 sodium ions along with 1 iodide (2:1 stoichiometry). The electrochemical gradient of sodium serves as the driving force for iodide uptake and it is generated and maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which is located in the same membrane of the thyrocytes. The iodide molecules, after their active transport in the cytoplasm, are passively translocated in the follicular lumen via the transporter protein pendrin and possibly other unknown efflux proteins that are located on the apical membrane (Bizhanova and Kopp, 2009). Subsequently, the thyroid hormones are synthesized in the follicular lumen by incorporating the accumulated iodide, a process which is significantly suppressed in case of NIS dysfunction or inhibition (reviewed in Spitzweg and Morris, 2010). NIS is the last thyroid-related component to be expressed during development at the 10th gestational week, which temporaly coincides with the onset of thyroid function and hormonogenesis (Szinnai et al., 2007). Albeit the localization of NIS is not fully completed at this stage, the iodide accumulation has already started. Mutations of NIS gene (SLCA5A) cause expression of non-functional NIS molecule leading to inability of the thyrocyte to accumulate iodide (Matsuda and Koshugi, 1997; Pohlenz et al., 1998), a condition called iodide transport defect (ITD). This is a rear autosomic recessive disease, which if not properly treated is clinically identified by congenital hypothyroidism, goiter, low I- uptake, low saliva/plasma I- ratio and mental impairment of varying degrees (Dohan et al., 2003). Up to date 13 mutations have been described in the NIS gene (Spitzweg and Morris, 2010) and each one of them produces mutants with different structure but in all cases non-functional. The extensive study after NIS molecular characterization and the numerous findings have convinced the scientists that is one of the most crucial components of the entire thyroid system. Additionally, after the realization that NIS could be also used as diagnostic and therapeutic tool for thyroid and non-thyroid cancers (Portulano et al., 2013) a new research activity concerning this specific mechanism has been initiated."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/425","Decrease of Thyroidal iodide","KE 425","Biological state: Iodine (I2) is a non-metallic chemical element which is required for the normal cellular metabolism. It is one of the essential components of the TH, comprising 65% and 58% of T4&#39;s and T3&#39;s weight, respectively and therefore it is crucial for the normal thyroid function. It is a trace element and a healthy human body contains 15-20 mg of iodine, most of which is concentrated in the thyroid gland (Dunn, 1998). Iodide (I-) that enters the thyroid gland remains in the free state only briefly and subsequently it bounds to the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin to form the precursors of the thyroid hormones mono-iodinated tyrosine (MIT) or di-iodinated tyrosine (DIT) (Berson and Yalow, 1955). The bounding rate of iodide is 50-100% of the intra-thyroidal iodide pool, meaning that only a very small proportion of this element is free in the thyroid and this comes mainly by the deiodination of MIT and DIT.

The body is not able to produce or make iodine, thus the diet is the only source of this element. Iodine is found in nature in various forms, such as inorganic sodium and potassium salts (iodides and iodates), inorganic diatomic iodine and organic monoatomic iodine (Patrick, 2008). Thus, it is widely distributed in the environment but in many regions of the world the soil&#39;s iodine has been depleted due to different environmental phenomena. In these regions, the incidence of iodine deficiency is greatly increased (Ahad and Ganie, 2010).

The daily iodine intake of adult humans varies greatly due to the different dietary habits between the different regions on earth (Dunn, 1993). In any case, the ingested iodine is absorbed through the intestine and transported into the plasma to reach the thyroid gland. However, thyroid is not the only organ of the body that concentrates iodide. It has been shown that other tissues have also the ability of iodide concentration, such as the salivary glands, the gastric mucosa, the mammary glands and the choroid plexus, all of which express NIS, the iodine transporter protein (Jhiang et al., 1998; Cho et al., 2000).

Biological compartments: A sodium-iodide (Na/I) symporter pumps iodide (IO) actively into the cell, which previously has crossed the endothelium by largely unknown mechanisms. This iodide enters the follicular lumen from the cytoplasm by the transporter pendrin, in a purportedly passive manner. In the colloid, iodide (I&minus;) is oxidized to iodine (I0) by an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase (TPO). IO is very reactive and iodinates the thyroglobulin at tyrosyl residues in its protein chain. In conjugation, adjacent tyrosyl residues are paired together. Thyroglobulin binds the megalin receptor for endocytosis back into the follicular cell. Proteolysis by various proteases liberates thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine molecules (T3), which enter the bloodstream where they are bound to thyroid hormone binding proteins, mainly thyroxin binding globulin (TBG) which accounts for about 75% of the bound hormone. The adult thyroid absorbs 60-80 &mu;g of iodide per day to maintain the thyroid homeostasis (Degroot, 1966). Inadequate amount of iodide results to deficient production of thyroid hormones, which consequently leads to an increase of TSH secretion and goiter, as compensating effect (Delange, 2000). On the other hand, excess iodide could also inhibit TH synthesis (Wolff and Chaikoff, 1948). The proposed mechanism for this latter effect is the possible formation of 2-iodohexadecanal that inhibits the generation of H2O2 and the subsequent oxidation of iodide in the thyroid follicular cells. The lack of oxidized free radicals of iodide affects the reaction with the tyrosine residues of Thyroglobulin (Tg) (Panneels et al., 1994). During pregnancy, the organism of the mother is also supporting the needs of the foetus and therefore the iodide requirements are greatly increased (Glinoer, 1997). Additionally, small iodine concentrations have been found to have significant antioxidant effects that resembles to ascorbic acid (Smyth, 2003).

General role in biology: The most important role of iodine is the formation of the thyroid hormones (T4 and T3). The thyroid actively concentrates the circulating iodide through the basolateral membrane of the thyrocytes by the sodium/iodide symporter protein (NIS). The concentrated thyroid-iodine is oxidized in the follicular cells of the gland and consequently binds to tyrosines to form mono- or di-iodotyrosines (MIT and DIT respectively), being incorporated into thyroglobulin. This newly formed iodothyroglobulin forms one of the most important constituents of the colloid material, present in the follicle of the thyroid unit. If two di-iodotyrosine molecules couple together, the result is the formation of thyroxin (T4). If a di-iodotyrosine and a mono-iodotyrosine are coupled together, the result is the formation of tri-iodothyronine (T3). From the perspective of the formation of thyroid hormone, the major coupling reaction is the di-iodotyrosine coupling to produce T4."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/446","Reduction, fetal/adult testosterone","KE 446","Biological state

Testosterone (T) is a steroid hormone from the androgen group. T serves as a substrate for two metabolic pathways that produce antagonistic sex steroids.

Biological compartments

Testosterone is synthesized by the gonads and other steroidogenic tissues (e.g., brain, adipose), acts locally and/or is transported to other tissues via blood circulation. Leydig cells are the testosterone-producing cells of the testis.

General role in biology

Androgens, the main male sex steroids, are the critical factors responsible for the development of the male phenotype during embryogenesis and for the achievement of sexual maturation at puberty. In adulthood, androgens remain essential for the maintenance of male reproductive function and behaviour. Apart from their effects on reproduction, androgens affect a wide variety of non-reproductive tissues such as skin, bone, muscle, and brain (Heemers, Verhoeven, &amp; Swinnen, 2006). Androgens, principally T and 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), exert most of their effects by interacting with a specific receptor, the androgen receptor (AR), for review see (Murashima, Kishigami, Thomson, &amp; Yamada, 2015). On the one hand, testosterone can be reduced by 5&alpha;-reductase to produce 5&alpha; dihydrotestosterone (DHT). On the other hand, testosterone can be aromatized to generate estrogens. Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence, postnatal effects in both males and females are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/447","Reduction, Cholesterol transport in mitochondria","KE 447","Biological state
Steroidogenesis begins with the transport of cholesterol from intracellular stores into mitochondria. This process involves a series of protein-protein interactions involving cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins located at both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. In steroidogenic cells the cholesterol import to the mitochondrial inner membrane is crucial for steroid synthesis (Rone, Fan, and Papadopoulos 2009). This process is facilitated by the Scavenger Receptor Class B, type 1 (SR-B1) [more relevant for rodents, than for humans] that mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from high-density lipoproteins. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) and the translator protein (TSPO) [former peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)]  mediate cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is done by Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), the start of steroidogenesis [reviewed in (Miller and Auchus 2011)].

Biological compartments
In mitochondria of steroidogenic tissues there are two specialized mechanisms related to hormone synthesis: one by which cholesterol is delivered to the mitochondria and the other by which specialized intra-mitochondrial enzymes participate in the synthesis of hormonal steroids. 

General role in biology
Systemic steroid hormones are primarily formed by the gonads, adrenal glands, and during in utero development by the placenta. Some other organs like brain (Baulieu 1998), and heart (Kayes-Wandover and White 2000) have also been identified as steroid-producing tissues, mainly for local needs. The steroid hormones are indispensable for mammalian life. They are made from cholesterol via complex biosynthetic pathways that are initiated by specialized, tissue-specific enzymes in mitochondria. These hormones include glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) produced in the adrenal cortex, estrogens (estradiol), progestins (progesterone) and androgens (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone) produced in the gonads, and calciferols (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25OH2D]) produced in the kidneys (Miller and Auchus 2011). Cholesterol is the precursor for the synthesis of steroid hormones in mitochondria. Steroidogenesis begins with the metabolism of cholesterol to pregnenolone facilitated by P450scc. The rate of steroid formation depends on the rate of cholesterol transport from intracellular stores to the inner mitochondrial membrane and the loading of P450scc with cholesterol (Miller and Auchus 2011). 
Interference with one or more of these reactions leads to reduced steroid production."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/493","Increased, Insufficient repair or mis-repair of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts","KE 493","The AFB1-induced pro-mutagenic DNA adducts, N7-AFB1-G and /or AFB1-FAPy, are recognized by DNA repair proteins or systems, which then initiate their repair processes (Bedard and Massey, 2006).  
Although there are no data specific to AFB1 for this key event of insufficient/mis-repair of DNA, it is a process known to occur and known to result in mutations. The system that recognizes the damage depends in part upon which stage of the cell cycle is in progress when the pro-mutagenic DNA adducts are recognized. Initial steps can include recruitment of a series of proteins specific to that repair system and can also include blocking of progress of the DNA replication fork. This latter step ensures that DNA replication waits for repair to occur before proceeding, preventing replication of the damaged DNA, thus avoiding a mutation when the repair might otherwise faithfully copy the error.
Mis-repair: For many of the DNA repair systems the repair process is quite faithful; that is, damage is correctly repaired with the correct or original base substituted for the adducted base. This is not always the case, however, and erroneous repair is one source of mutations, when an incorrect base inserted opposite a correct or an adducted base (mis-repair). 
Insufficient repair: An alternative route to mutation can occur when on-going DNA replication is not stopped, and DNA replication occurs across an adducted (typically non-informational lesion) base that has not undergone any repair (insufficient repair). This situation can result in the incorporation of an incorrect base into the nascent DNA strand.  
Insufficient repair or mis-repair results in an incorrect base incorporated into the nascent DNA strand, an error which is then eventually replicated, resulting in a so-called “fixed” change in the primary DNA sequence; that is, a mutation.  This mutation may be silent (no impact on protein product structure and/or function) or expressed (non-functional or differently functional protein product). Depending on the location or gene of the expressed mutation, it may have a substantial or slight biological impact, or can have no impact.  For example, if the mutation is located in codon 249 of the p53 gene and is expressed, there is potential for substantial biological impact, including steps on a pathway to carcinogenesis. There is less likelihood of a substantial biological impact when a mutation results in no change in the coded amino acid due to lack of stringency in the genetic code. Likewise a change in amino acid sequence may not result in any change in the activity or function of the protein product.

Level of Biological Organization
Repair of DNA adducts occurs at the sub-cellular level, as the target is nuclear DNA.  For AFB1, the cross-species critical target is repair of hepatocyte nuclear DNA, as the eventual AFB1-induced tumor is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is initiated in hepatocytes.

Evidence Supporting Essentiality
Strong
Evidence supporting the insufficient repair or mis-repair of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts is strong, but mainly indirect.  This evidence comes from different biological systems and datasets, mostly mammalian, and is based in large part on the biological understanding of a DNA-reactive mode of action requiring a change in primary DNA sequence (mutation). Such a change occurs when DNA lesions are not repaired prior to cell replication (Preston and Williams, 2005; Jarabek et al, 2009; Pottenger et al., 2014).  AFB1 forms two types of pro-mutagenic adducts: N7-AFB1-G and AFB1-FAPy DNA adducts, and resulting mutations are predominantly G:C to T:A transversions. These changes are the expected result of such adducts not being repaired or undergoing mis-repair (Bedard and Massey, 2006; Lin et al., 2014a,b).
Data from diverse cell types and systems demonstrate that AFB1-induced DNA adducts are repaired by a variety of DNA repair processes, including SOS repair, nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination (HR), and post-replication repair (Bedard and Massey, 2006).  The work by Guo et al. (2005), conducted in transgenic yeast modified to express human CYP1A2, is particularly useful as several DNA repair systems were evaluated for efficacy towards the AFB1-induced DNA adducts.  Mutations were more likely to be induced in strains deficient in certain repair systems. Mutations were also induced in strains with active secondary repair pathways; these include pathways for error-prone post-replication repair and those relying on apurinic endonucleases. However, NER appears to be most important for repair of AFB1-induced adducts in mammalian systems (Bedard and Massey, 2006).
The codon 249 of the p53 gene has been identified as a particular target of AFB1-induced adduction and subsequent mutation. Using DNA polymerase fingerprint analysis, Puiseux et al. (1991) showed a specificity of AFB1 epoxide binding for this codon. This  specificity was not found with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), although B[a]P also forms bulky, intercalating epoxides, similar to AFB1 exo-epoxide, which result in bulky N7-B[a]P-G adducts. 
Essentiality of this key event of insufficient or mis-repair is supported in part by datasets demonstrating that a reduction in AFB1 adduct burden (e.g., 65-70% reduction) results in a significantly reduced or even eliminated altered hepatic foci (AHF) and liver tumor burden in experimental animals (Roebuck et al., 1991; Elegbede and Gould, 2002; Yates et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2014). Data from studies in human populations show that treatment with known modulators of AFB1 metabolism (e.g., with oltipraz or chlorophyllin) resulted in reduced urinary levels of N7-AFB1-G, derived from AFB1-induced DNA adducts (Egner et al., 2006). These treatments are also observed to decrease levels of a human biomarker of exposure, AFB1-induced albumin adducts (Kensler et al., 1998).  A similar dataset in rats pre-treated with the triterpenoid, ODDC-Im, provides an even more convincing picture, wherein a chronic bioassay demonstrated a ~60% reduction in AFB1 DNA adducts, complete elimination of liver tumors, and nearly complete elimination of altered hepatic foci (Johnson et al., 2014).
Some studies suggest that eukaryotic NER expression is induced by exposure to phytochemicals (Gross-Steinmeyer et al. 2010), and alteration of DNA repair has been suggested as a pathway of chemoprevention for AFB1 carcinogenesis (Gross-Steinmeyer and Eaton, 2012)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/52","Decreased, Calcium influx","KE 52","Biological state: Under physiological resting conditions of the cell, the free intracellular Ca2+ reaches around 100 nM, whereas the extracellular Ca2+ can be found at higher concentrations of 1.2 mM that under certain stimulus may invade the cell (Berridge et al, 2000). Six to seven oxygen atoms surround Ca2+, whereas the protein chelator of Ca2+ is the EF motif that is present in many proteins such as calmodulin (Clapham, 2007). The EF-hand is a helix-loop-helix calcium-binding motif in which two helices pack together at an angle of approximately 90 degrees (Lewit-Bentley and R&eacute;ty, 2000). The two helices are separated by a loop region where calcium actually binds. The EF notation for the motif is derived from the notation applied to the structure of parvalbumin, in which the E and F helices were originally identified as forming this calcium-binding motif.

Biological compartments: Ca2+ ions accumulate in the cytoplasm, cellular organelles (e.g. mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) and nucleus in response to diverse classes of stimuli.

General role in biology: In order to adapt to altered stimulus from exposure to different environmental factors, cells require signal transmission. However, signalling needs messengers whose concentration is modified upon stimulus (Clapham, 2007). Ca2+ ions act as an important intracellular messenger playing the role of ubiquitous signalling molecules and consequently regulate many different cellular functions (Berridge, 2012; Hagenston and Bading, 2011). Given its important role in processes that are fundamental to all cell types, Ca2+ homeostasis is tightly regulated by intracellular and extracellular mechanisms (Barhoumi et al., 2010). Intracellular Ca2+ concentration is regulated by opening or closing channels in the plasma membrane. Additionally, the Ca2+ ions can be released from intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through ryanodine receptors (RYRs) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Ca2+ homeostasis is also regulated by the mechanisms that remove Ca2+ from the cytosol, for example pumps in both cell membrane and ER membrane. In addition, cytosolic Ca2+ regulation involves accumulation of Ca2+ in mitochondria that have the capacity to buffer the excess of cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions. In neurons, Ca2+ ions regulate many critical functions. Firstly, they contribute to dendritic electrical signalling, producing postsynaptic depolarization by the current carried by Ca2+ ions. Secondly, Ca2+ activates Ca2+-sensitive proteins such as different kinases, calcineurin and calpain, triggering signalling pathways critical for cell physiology. Modification of the gene transcription is the final outcome of the Ca2+ ions impact on long-term modifications affecting neurotransmitters release (reviewed in Neher and Sakaba, 2008), neuronal differentiation, synapse function and cell viability (Clapham, 2007; Higley and Sabatini, 2012). Thus, the Ca2+ that enters and accumulates in cytoplasm and nucleus is a central signalling molecule that regulates synapse and neuronal cell function, including learning and memory processes (Berridge, 2012; Hagenston and Bading, 2011)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/54","Up Regulation, CD36","KE 54","Fatty acid translocase CD36 (FAT/CD36) is a scavenger protein mediating uptake and intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids (FA) in diverse cell types [1], [2]. In addition, CD36 can bind a variety of molecules including acetylated low density lipoproteins (LDL), collagen and phospholipids [3]. CD36 has been shown to be expressed in liver tissue [4], [5]. It is located in lipid rafts and non-raft domains of the cellular plasma membrane and most likely facilitates LCFA transport by accumulating LCFA on the outer surface [6], [7], [8].

FAT/CD36 gene is a liver specific target of LXR activation [9]. Studies have confirmed that the lipogenic effect of LXR and activation of FAT/CD36 was not a simple association, since the effect of LXR agonists on increasing hepatic and circulating levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFAs) was largely abolished in FAT/CD36 knockout mice suggesting that intact expression and/or activation of FAT/CD36 is required for the steatotic effect of LXR agonists [10], [11]. In addition to the well-defined pathogenic role of FAT/CD36 in hepatic steatosis in rodents the human up-regulation of the FAT/CD36 in NASH patients is confirmed [12]. There are now findings that can accelerate the translation of FAT/CD36 metabolic functions determined in rodents to humans [13] and suggest that the translocation of this fatty acid transporter to the plasma membrane of hepatocytes may contribute to liver fat accumulation in patients with NAFLD and HCV [14]. In addition, hepatic FAT/CD36 up-regulation is significantly associated with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and increased steatosis in patients with NASH and HCV G1 (Hepatitis C Virus Genotype1) with fatty liver. Recent data show that CD36 is also increased in the liver of morbidly obese patients and correlated to free FA levels [15]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/55","Increase, Cell injury/death","KE 55","Two types of cell death can be distinguished by morphological features, although it is likely that these are two ends of a spectrum with possible intermediate forms. Apoptosis involves shrinkage, nuclear disassembly, and fragmentation of the cell into discrete bodies with intact plasma membranes. These are rapidly phagocytosed by neighbouring cells. An important feature of apoptosis is the requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to initiate the execution phase. In contrast, necrotic cell death is characterized by cell swelling and lysis. This is usually a consequence of profound loss of mitochondrial function and resultant ATP depletion, leading to loss of ion homeostasis, including volume regulation, and increased intracellular Ca2+. The latter activates a number of nonspecific hydrolases (i.e., proteases, nucleases, and phospholipases) as well as calcium dependent kinases. Activation of calpain I, the Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease cleaves the death-promoting Bcl-2 family members Bid and Bax which translocate to mitochondrial membranes, resulting in release of truncated apoptosis-inducing factor (tAIF), cytochrome c and endonuclease in the case of Bid and cytocrome c in the case of Bax. tAIF translocates to cell nuclei, and together with cyclophilin A and phosphorylated histone H2AX (&gamma;H2AX) is responsible for DNA cleavage, a feature of programmed necrosis. Activated calpain I has also been shown to cleave the plasma membrane Na+&ndash;Ca2+ exchanger, which leads to build-up of intracellular Ca2+, which is the source of additional increased intracellular Ca2+. Cytochrome c in cellular apoptosis is a component of the apoptosome.

DNA damage activates nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP-1), a DNA repair enzyme. PARP-1 forms poly(ADP-ribose) polymers, to repair DNA, but when DNA damage is extensive, PAR accumulates, exits cell nuclei and travels to mitochondrial membranes, where it, like calpain I, is involved in AIF release from mitochondria. A fundamental distinction between necrosis and apoptosis is the loss of plasma membrane integrity; this is integral to the former but not the latter. As a consequence, lytic release of cellular constituents promotes a local inflammatory reaction, whereas the rapid removal of apoptotic bodies minimizes such a reaction. The distinction between the two modes of death is easily accomplished in vitro but not in vivo. Thus, although claims that certain drugs induce apoptosis have been made, these are relatively unconvincing. DNA fragmentation can occur in necrosis, leading to positive TUNEL staining (see explanation below). Conversely, when apoptosis is massive, it can exceed the capacity for rapid phagocytosis, resulting in the eventual appearance of secondary necrosis.

Two alternative pathways - either extrinsic (receptor-mediated) or intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) - lead to apoptotic cell death. The initiation of cell death begins either at the plasma membrane with the binding of TNF or FasL to their cognate receptors or within the cell. The latter is due to the occurrence of intracellular stress in the form of biochemical events such as oxidative stress, redox changes, covalent binding, lipid peroxidation, and consequent functional effects on mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, cytoskeleton, or DNA. The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway involves the initiator, caspase-9, which, when activated, forms an &ldquo;apoptosome&rdquo; in the cytosol, together with cytochrome c, which translocates from mitochondria, Apaf-1 and dATP. The apoptosome activates caspase-3, the central effector caspase, which in turn activates downstream factors that are responsible for the apoptotic death of a cell (Fujikawa, 2015). Intracellular stress either directly affects mitochondria or can lead to effects on other organelles, which then send signals to the mitochondria to recruit participation in the death process (Fujikawa, 2015; Malhi et al., 2010). Constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a Ca2+-dependent cytosolic enzyme that forms nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine, and NO reacts with the free radical such as superoxide (O2&minus;) to form the very toxic free radical peroxynitrite (ONOO&minus;). Free radicals such as ONOO&minus;, O2 &minus; and hydroxyl radical (OH&minus;) damage cellular membranes and intracellular proteins, enzymes and DNA (Fujikawa, 2015; Malhi et al., 2010; Kaplowitz, 2002; Kroemer et al., 2009)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/584","Inhibition, sodium channel","KE 584","Voltage-gated sodium channels consist of an alpha subunit and auxiliary beta subunits.  The alpha subunit is the ion pore-forming component of the channel and is organized into four homologous domains (I- IV), each with six trans-membrane alpha helices (S1-S6).  Between the S5 and S6  segments, there is a pore loop which is a primary target for anti-epileptic drugs.   The segments between S5 and S6  in each of the four domains create extracellular pore loops.  Amino acid  changes in the poor loops within domains II and IV determine if the ion channel is sensitive to sodium or calcium ions. Anti-epileptic, anti-arrhythmic and anesthetics all may bind this same site, but their action may be voltage-specific. For example, phenytoin is an ineffective block of hyperpolarized (e.g., -100mV) sodium channels, but is  more effective at blocking progressively depolarized potentials (e.g., -80 to -30 mV)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/593","Inhibition, Ether-a-go-go (ERG) voltage-gated potassium channel","KE 593","In cardiomyocytes, electical depolarization occurs upon the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.5) and the rapid influx of sodium ions. This influx causes the upstroke of the action potential (phase 0 in a human EKG). NaV channels turn off rapidly, but the depolarization causes Ca and K channels to open.  Calcium channels (Cav1.2) open and allow maintenance of depolarization.  Ca2+ entry also triggers contraction of the heart muscle.  Repolarization begins as  potassium channels open and allow K+ out of cell, balancing out the Ca2+ influx  to create the plateau of the action potential (phase 2).  Potassium channels terminate the action potential and return the cell to rest (phases 3 and 4). The ether a go-go gene (ERG;KCNH2) encodes for one of the ion channel proteins (the 'rapid' delayed rectifier current (IKr)) that conducts potassium (K+) ions out of the muscle cells.  This current is critical in correctly timing the return to the resting state (repolarization) of the cell membrane during the cardiac action potential (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006).  In other species,such as zebrafish, other ion channels may be absent (Alday et al., 2014), but the ERG channel is likely highly conserved.
In humans, the ERG potassium channel's pore is composed of 4 identical alpha subunits.   Each subunit consists of 6 transmembrane alpha helices, numbered S1-S6, a pore helix situated between S5 and S6, and cytoplasmically located N- and C-termini. Arginine or lysine amino acids present in the S4 helix likely acts as the voltage-sensitive sensor. Between the S5 and S6 helices, there is an extracellular loop (known as 'the turret') and 'the pore loop', which begins and ends extracellularly but loops into the plasma membrane; the four subunit pore loops form the selectivity filter inside the pore.  
The relatively large inner vestibule of the ERG channel permits binding of many pharmaceutical agents of diverse structure and function.  The more common drugs which can result in ERG block include antiarrhythmics (especially Class 1A and Class III), anti-psychotic agents, and certain antibiotics (including quinolones and macrolides). Binding of the ERG channel and subsequent inhibition of the Ikr can result in prolonged QT syndrome, Torsade de Points or bradycardia."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/616","Occurrence, A paroxysmal depolarizing shift","KE 616","A paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS) or depolarizing shift is a cellular manifestation of epilepsy. As summarized by Lomen-Hoerth and Messing (2010), brain electrical activity is nonsynchronous under normal conditions. In epileptic seizures, a large group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner, which results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (Somjen, 2004). Normally after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time, owing in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine. However, in epilepsy the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased, likely due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a &quot;seizure focus&quot;.

Increased, abnormal neuron firing causes a wave of depolarization throughout the brain/neuronal tissue. At the level of single neurons, epileptiform activity consists of sustained neuronal depolarization resulting in a burst of action potentials, a plateau-like depolarization associated with completion of the action potential burst, and then a rapid repolarization followed by hyperpolarization. This sequence is also called paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS). The bursting activity resulting from the relatively prolonged depolarization of the neuronal membrane is due to influx of extracellular Ca2+, which leads to the opening of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, influx of Na+, and generation of repetitive action potentials. The subsequent hyperpolarizing afterpotential is mediated by iGABA receptors and Cl- influx, or by K+ efflux, depending on the cell type (Bromfield et al. 2006)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/618","Decreased, Neuronal network function in adult brain","KE 618","Biological state:
In the brain, neurons never work alone. They create a network where the activity of one cell directly influences many others. Each neuron is a specialized cell and when activated, it fires an electrochemical signal along the axon. A neuron fires only if the total signal received at the cell body from the dendrites exceeds a certain level (the firing threshold). The strength of the signal received by a neuron (and therefore its chances of firing) critically depends on the efficacy of the synapses. Each synapse actually contains a synaptic cleft with neurotransmitter that transmits a signal across the gap.  During synaptic transmission neurotransmitters are released by a presynaptic neuron and bind to and activate the receptors of the postsynaptic neuron  in response to a threshold of action potential. Synaptic transmission relies on: the availability of the neurotransmitter; the release of the neurotransmitter by exocytosis; the binding of the postsynaptic receptor by the neurotransmitter; the functional response of the postsynaptic cell; and the subsequent removal or deactivation of the neurotransmitter. 
Neurons form complex networks of synapses through which action potentials travel. When the nerve impulse arrives at the synapse, it may cause the release of neurotransmitters, which influence another (postsynaptic) neuron. The postsynaptic neurons receive inputs from many additional neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory. The excitatory and inhibitory influences are summed (neural summation) resulting in inhibition or ""firing"" (i.e., generate an action potential) if the threshold potential has been reached. The voltage at which an action potential is triggered happens if  enough voltage-dependent sodium channels are activated and  the net inward sodium current exceeds all outward currents (Kolb and Whishaw, 2003). Therefore, at the beginning of the action potential, the Na+ channels open and Na+ moves into the axon, causing depolarization. Re-polarization occurs when the K+ channels open and K+ moves out of the axon. This creates a change in polarity between the  outside of the cell and the inside. The impulse travels down from the axon hillock in one direction only, to the axon terminal. Here, the  neurotransmitter is released releasing neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft to pass along information to another adjacent neuron. Excitatory inputs bring a neuron closer to a firing threshold, while inhibitory inputs bring the neuron farther from threshold. An action potential is an ""all-or-none"" event; neurons whose membranes have not reached threshold will not fire, while those that do, will fire. 
One of the most influential researchers into neurological systems (Donald Hebb) postulated that learning consisted principally in altering the ""strength"" of synaptic networking. Recent research in cognitive science, in particular in the area of non-conscious information processing, have further demonstrated the enormous capacity of the human mind to learn simple input-output co-variations from extremely complex stimuli. Consequently, the neurodegeneration and cell death disrupt the natural rhythms of brain network communication. Cognitive disorders are primarily associated with dysfunction of the neurons of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and with changes mainly in NMDARs function (Wang et al, 2015).  
Biological compartments:
The interface through which neurons interact with their neighbours usually consists of several axon terminals connected via synapses to dendrites on other neurons. If the hippocampal or cortical neurons are damaged or killed by the over-activation of receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, such as the NMDA, kainate and AMPA receptors, the neuronal networking and number of synapses are decreased. Indeed, it has been proved that lesions of the hippocampus in humans prevent the acquisition of new episodic memories suggesting that hippocampus-dependent memory is mediated, at least in part, by hippocampal synaptic plasticity that is a prominent feature of hippocampal synapses of the  neuronal network (Neves et al., 2008). Since the finding that the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in long-term memory consolidation (dogma, well established fact in the literature, described in the text books; e.g. Andersen et al., 2007; Byrne, 2008; Eichenbaum, 2002), many proposals have been made regarding its specific role.  A prominent view of the mechanisms underlying consolidation of episodic memories involves fast formation (e.g., via Hebbian mechanisms) of strong associations between hippocampal sparse patterns of activity and distributed neocortical representations.
Recent research on the primate prefrontal cortex discovered that the pyramidal cell circuits that generate the persistent firing underlying spatial working memory communicate through synapses on spines containing NMDARs with NR2B subunits (GluN2B) in the post-synaptic density. This contrasts with synapses in the hippocampus and primary visual cortex, where GluN2B receptors are both synaptic and extrasynaptic. Cholinergic stimulation of nicotinic α7 receptors within the glutamate synapse is necessary for NMDAR actions (Wang and Arnsten, 2015).
General role in biology:
Glutamatergic neurotransmission (NMDA, AMPA and KA receptors)
The network of glutamatergic neurons is heavily involved in long-term synaptic plasticity, the main process linked to learning and memory. At the same time over-activation of these neurons (excitotoxicity) leads to  neuronal cell death that can be mediated by increased levels of extracellular glutamate or a molecule that behaves as its analogue. Glutamate acts at a variety of ionotropic receptors, including AMPARs, kainate receptors, and NMDARs. The NMDARs have been of particular interest due to their unique properties.  They require neuronal depolarization to relieve their Mg++ block, and are permeable to Ca++ that can initiate second-messenger signalling events, such as mediating neuroplasticity or negative feedback through Ca++-sensitive K+ channels. There have been extensive studies on the glutamate NMDAR and AMPAR mechanisms underlying long-term synaptic plasticity in the primary visual cortex and in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus (Liu et al., 2004; Cho et al., 2009; Lüscher and Malenka, 2012). 
Neuronal network function and long-term plasticity is also regulated by the levels of AMPAR expression as the number of AMPARs inserted into the post-synaptic density can mediate the degree of spine depolarization and thus the NMDAR opening.  Synaptic plasticity in the mature visual cortex appears to be governed by GluN2A subunits, which have faster kinetics than GluN2B. GluN2B receptors are expressed in synapses early in development, but many move to extra-synaptic locations in the mature visual cortex and hippocampus (Goebel-Goody et al., 2009). The actions of NMDARs on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neuronal circuitry network underlying spatial working memory in primates and it mechanism is described in detail by Wang and Arnsten (2015). In the hippocampus, there is some evidence that long-term potentiation (LTP) is mediated by synaptic GluN2A, while long-term depression is mediated by extrasynaptic GluN2B receptors (Liu et al., 2004).
Kainate receptors (KARs) also play an important role in neuronal network function. They play a major function in the pre-synaptic terminal, in particular in the hippocampus. Activation of kainate receptors in have been shown to regulate glutamate release (Jane et al., 2009) and to both depress and factilitate transmission in different synapses.  Pre-synaptic kainate receptors in the hippocampus facilitate AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated transmission at mossy fibre-CA3 synapses (Lauri et al, 2005). Activation of post-synaptic KARs facilitates activation of NMDARs as it has been described in the context of DomA exposure.
Role of other neurotransmitters
It is important to stress that other classical neurotransmitter systems also play an important role in learning and memory processes (Blokland 1996).  The role of the most critical neurotransmitters has been evaluated in a meta-analysis based on studies of four behavioral tasks  relevant for evaluation of rat cognitive functions such as  Morris water maze, radial maze, passive avoidance, and spontaneous alternation (Myhrer, 2003). Calculation of impact factors (percentage of significant effects of chemical agents like agonists, antagonists, neurotoxins) showed that glutamate was ranking highest (93), followed by GABA (81), dopamine (81), acetylcholine (81), serotonin (55), and norepinephrine (48). 
GABA-ergic receptors: indeed, presynaptic GABA B receptors mediate GABA-dependent inhibition of glutamate release, impacting plasticity of hippocampal synapses and hippocampus-dependent memory function (Vigot et al., 2006). A critical link between GABABR heterodimer conformational dynamics and local regulation of release probability at hippocampal synapses has been recently proved (Laviv et al., 2010).
5-Hydroxytrytamine (serotonin) type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs), as the only ligand-gated ion channels in the serotonin receptor family, are known to regulate neuronal excitation and release of GABA in hippocampal interneurons, playing also  an important role in glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. Deletion of the 5-HT3AR gene in transgenic mice abolished NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in hippocampal CA1 synapses in slices.  In addition, 5-HT3ARs disruption inhibited AMPARs internalization, without altering basal surface levels of AMPARs. These observations revealed an important role of 5-HT3ARs in NMDAR-dependent long-term depression, which is critical for learning behaviours (Yu et al., 2014). 
The cholinergic hypothesis claims that the decline in cognitive functions in dementia is predominantly related to a decrease in cholinergic neurotransmission. This hypothesis has led to great interest in the putative involvement of the cholinergic neurotransmission in learning and memory  processes (Blokland 1996; Bracco et al., 2014). 
Dopamine plays diverse roles in human behaviour and cognition but it is mainly involved in motivation, decision-making, reward processing, attention, working memory and learning (Steinberg and Janak, 2012; Labudda et al., 2010).
Noradrenaline is associated with memory processing as it induces lasting changes in the brain that could sustain memories over time (Gazarini et al., 2013). As confirmed later on its neurotransmission indeed strengthens memory-related synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation, allowing memories to be formed and maintained in a more intense and enduring manner, a notion particularly valid for those with emotional content (Joëls et al. 2011). Like other types of memory, an emotional memory has to be consolidated to allow its later retrieval. Accumulating evidence has indicated that noradrenaline acts during these gradual stages to fine-tune the strength and/or persistence of a memory (Guzmán-Ramos et al. 2012; Gazarini et al., 2013)."

&quot;Upon prolonged and repeated exposure to a nAChR agonist, desensitizationmay
occur.Desensitization is characterized by an initial opening
of the ion channel and ion exchange across the cell membrane followed
by rapid channel closure and inactivity, effectively inhibiting neurotransmission
(Quick and Lester, 2002). Further, inhibition of nAChR activity
from desensitization can lead to an up-regulation in nAChR
expression, termed pharmacological chaperoning (Srinivasan et al.,
2012; Flores et al., 1992; Marszalec et al., 2005). Exposure to
imidacloprid and thiamethoxam for 72 or 48 h, respectively was
shown to significantly increase transcriptional abundance of nAChR&alpha;1
subunit in the honey bee brain (Christen et al., 2016). In the
desensitized state, nAChR receptors have high affinity for the agonist
and therefore establish a blockade to subsequent agonist binding
(Ochoa et al., 1989). It has been demonstrated that recovery from
nAChR desensitization occurs (though not always complete) upon removal
of the agonist (Ochoa et al., 1989). However, the speed of recovery
is dependent on the concentration and duration of exposure to the
agonist, with longer exposures typically resulting in slower recovery
times (Quick and Lester, 2002). In fact, loss of functional nAChR channels
has been reported in neuronal cell line PC12 (rat adrenal gland
pheochromocytoma tumor) upon prolonged exposure to carbachol, a
cholinergic agonist (Simasko et al., 1986).
Phosphorylation of nAChR subunits is another factor that regulates
the rate of desensitization and subsequent recovery. Nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor subunits possess phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent
protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), calciumcalmodulin-
dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) and endogenous
protein tyrosine kinase (Hopfield et al., 1988; Thany et al., 2007). Evidence
suggests that phosphorylation of nAChR subunits regulate the
rate of desensitization,with the greater number of phosphotyrosines indicative
of rapid recovery from desensitization (Hopfield et al., 1988;
Thany et al., 2007).&quot;"

As shown in Figure 1, binding of GABA opens up the chloride channel in the iGABAR complex, leading to neuronal inhibition (Olsen et al. 2004). Non-competitive channel blockers (e.g., fipronil, lindane, picrotoxin, penicillin and alpha-endosulfan) indirectly modulate the iGABAR activity (i.e., alter the response of the receptor to agonist) by noncompetitively binding at or near the central pore of the receptor complex (e.g., the picrotoxin site), an allosteric site distinct from that of the orthosteric agonist binding site, and inducing a conformational change within the receptor (Ernst et al. 2005; Johnston 2005).

Mounting evidence indicates that iGABAR chloride channel blockers bind to overlapping but not identical sites (Kalueff 2007). Based on the mapping of convulsants&#39; binding domains to the iGABAR chloride ionophore (Olsen 2006), Kalueff (2007) proposed a &quot;big picrotoxin binding pocket&quot; model for the ligand-binding area of ionophore. For instance, bicyclophosphates, butyrolactones, pentylenetetrazole and penicillin act on the N-terminus of TM2 (&lsquo;&lsquo;main&rsquo;&rsquo; picrotoxin binding site), whereas picrotoxin may act on the &quot;main&quot; as well as a hypothetical second &lsquo;&lsquo;allosteric&rsquo;&rsquo; picrotoxin site located on the C-terminus of TM2 (Kalueff 2007; Olsen 2006). In spite of minor differences, these blockers share similarity in channel blockage characteristics (e.g., voltage-dependency, binding to closed channel, reversible, and non-competitive) and effects of channel state (open/closed frequency and duration) (Kalueff 2007). Nevertheless, the 3D structure of iGABAR ionophore is unavailable. More homology modeling work (similar to the electron microscopic structure of nicotinic receptor channel (Unwin 2005)) may allow us to gain in-depth understanding of the picrotoxin site&#39;s accessibility for and interactions with channel blockers (i.e., convulsants), clarify the biological functions of the binding sites, and verify the impact of mutations in TM2 on ligand binding activity (Kalueff 2007)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/68","Accumulation, Collagen","KE 68","Collagen is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. It is also abundant in corneas, cartilage, bones, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen is the main structural protein in the extracellular space in the various connective tissues, making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. In normal tissues, collagen provides strength, integrity, and structure. When tissues are disrupted following injury, collagen is needed to repair the defect. If too much collagen is deposited, normal anatomical structure is lost, function is compromised, and fibrosis results.

The fibroblast is the most common collagen producing cell. Collagen-producing cells may also arise from the process of transition of differentiated epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. This has been observed e.g. during renal fibrosis (transformation of tubular epithelial cells into fibroblasts) and in liver injury (transdifferentiation of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes into fibroblasts) (Henderson and Iredale, 2007).

There are close to 20 different types of collagen found with the predominant form being type I collagen. This fibrillar form of collagen represents over 90 percent of our total collagen and is composed of three very long protein chains which are wrapped around each other to form a triple helical structure called a collagen monomer. Collagen is produced initially as a larger precursor molecule called procollagen. As the procollagen is secreted from the cell, procollagen proteinases remove the extension peptides from the ends of the molecule. The processed molecule is referred to as collagen and is involved in fiber formation. In the extracellular spaces the triple helical collagen molecules line up and begin to form fibrils and then fibers. Formation of stable crosslinks within and between the molecules is promoted by the enzyme lysyl oxidase and gives the collagen fibers tremendous strength (Diegelmann,2001). The overall amount of collagen deposited by fibroblasts is a regulated balance between collagen synthesis and collagen catabolism. Disturbance of this balance leads to changes in the amount and composition of collagen. Changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix initiate positive feedback pathways that increase collagen production.

Normally, collagen in connective tissues has a slow turn over; degradating enzymes are collagenases, belonging to the family of matrix metalloproteinases. Other cells that can synthesize and release collagenase are macrophages, neutrophils, osteoclasts, and tumor cells (Di Lullo et al., 2002; Kivirikko and Risteli, 1976; Miller and Gay, 1987; Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/682","Generation, Amplified excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)","KE 682","In neuroscience, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is defined as a neurotransmitter-induced postsynaptic potential change that depolarizes the cell, and hence increases the likelihood of initiating a postsynaptic action potential (Purves et al. 2001). On the contrary, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) decreases this likelihood. Whether a postsynaptic response is an EPSP or an IPSP depends on the type of channel that is coupled to the receptor, and on the concentration of permeant ions inside and outside the cell. In fact, the only factor that distinguishes postsynaptic excitation from inhibition is the reversal potential of the postsynaptic potential (PSP) in relation to the threshold voltage for generating action potentials in the postsynaptic cell. When an active presynaptic cell releases neurotransmitters into the synapse, some of them bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Many of these receptors contain an ion channel capable of passing positively charged ions (e.g., Na+ or K+) or negatively charged ions (e.g., Cl-) either into or out of the cell. In epileptogenesis, discharges reduced GABAA receptor-mediated hyperpolarizing IPSPs by shifting their reversal potentials in a positive direction. At the same time, the amplitudes of Schaffer collateral-evoked RS-&alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated EPSPs and action potential-independent miniature EPSPs were enhanced, whereas N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated EPSPs remained unchanged. Together, these changes in synaptic transmission produce a sustained increase in hippocampal excitability (Lopantsev et al. 2009)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/709","Increase, Cytotoxicity (renal tubular cell)","KE 709","The renal proximal tubule is a crucial section of the nephron, responsible for the bulk of its reabsorption capabilities. About 60-70% of glomerular filtrate such as water, small molecules, and important ions, as well as nearly all the filtered amino acids, small peptides, and glucose are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule (Carson, 2019). The process of solute reabsorption is highly energetically expensive, making the proximal tubules the renal region of highest oxygen consumption. The microvilli, densely packed to form the brush border apical surface of the tubules, have abundant elongated mitochondria to sustain the energetic demand of their function (Carlson, 2019). The introduction of heavy metals into the kidneys causes aggregation in the proximal tubules due to their high mitochondrial content, leading to inhibition of the electron transport chain and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This area is particularly susceptible to heavy metal toxicity due to the abundance of mitochondria, as well as the fact that, regardless of toxicity, approximately 70% of cation absorption and transport passes through the proximal tubules (Barbier et al., 2005). Some heavy metal transport into the proximal tubules is conducted by MRP-1 and MRP-2 (ATP binding cassette-multidrug resistance proteins), and characterize toxicity by GSH depletion as some metals such as arsenic bind GSH and increased oxidative stress induced by free radicals (Sabath &amp; Robles-Osorio, 2012). This oxidative stress causes disruption to mitochondrial homeostasis and mitophagy in proximal tubular epithelial cells by altering PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) (Small et al., 2018). At high enough concentrations of toxic heavy metals they can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. An issue with assessment of kidney function is that the kidneys notoriously compensate for loss of function, leading to the appearance of adverse affects only at a late onset when there is very severe levels of damage (de Burbure et al., 2003).

Cell Death and Cytotoxicity

Cell death is a variety of processes defined by a cell ceasing to perform its function. This could happen by a variety of mechanisms. Apoptosis is a programmed physiological sequence leading to controlled cell death deemed necessary for the fitness and survival of the organism (cell is redundant, dysfunctional, cancerous, etc.) (Choi et al., 2019). Apoptosis, in the case of DNA damage, can be induced by free radicals produced as a result of heavy metal exposure, as shown in ex-vivo studies (Miller et al., 2002). Another cause by heavy metal exposure is physical and structural damage to mitochondria, damaging cellular metabolism and ATP production. There are many possible stressors that may lead to cell death, the effects exhibited depend on the cell type and the severity of the stress (Liu et al., 2018). Some modes of cell death include: apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis (uncontrolled cell death), and aging-caused cell death, known as senescent death  (Liu et al., 2018).

Apoptosis, also referred to as programmed cell death, is the predetermined procedure by which an organism disposes of cells that are no longer productive (Liu et al., 2018; Elmore, 2007). Apoptosis biochemically  manifests as cytoplasmic shrinkage, cytoskeleton collapse, chromatin condensation (pyknosis), nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, altered Bcl-2 family protein expression or activation, plasma membrane blebbing, and in larger cells, the formation of apoptotic bodies. The surface of cells undergoing apoptosis is chemically altered to signal nearby cells and macrophages that then rapidly engulf them before they spill their contents (Alberts et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2019). Apoptosis occurs in three general phases: initiation, effector, and final. Variation can be seen as the initiation phase is dependant on stimuli, and there are two effector phase modes; an extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Regardless of the pathway of the first 2 phases, the final stage of apoptosis is caspase-3 activation (Priant et al., 2019). The initiation and execution of apoptosis and other cell death processes is induced by the proteolytic activity of caspase as it cleaves the aspartic acid residues of proteins. The caspases can be broadly divided into two groups: those that are mainly involved in apoptosis (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10) and those related to caspase-1, whose primary role appears to be cytokine processing and pro-inflammatory cell death (caspase-1, -4, -5, -11, -12, -13, and -14). The apoptotic caspases can further be divided into initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) and executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and-7) (Fink &amp; Cookson, 2005). Once the initial caspase activation occurs the resultant caspase cascade is irreversible (Alberts et al., 2014).

 

The extrinsic pathway, also known as the death receptor-mediated pathway, involves the ligation of death receptors determining the activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 further activates downstream caspases leading to apoptosis (Priante et al., 2019). This pathway is triggered by extracellular signalling proteins binding to cell-surface death receptors. A well understood example of this process is the activation of the Fas receptor on the surface of a target cell by Fas ligand (FasL) on the surface of a cytotoxic lymphocyte (Alberts et al., 2014). In this process, the cytosolic Fas death receptor binds intracellular adaptor proteins. This complex then binds initiator, caspases, primarily caspase-8, forming a death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The initiator caspases, once dimerized and activated in the DISC, activate downstream executioner caspases to induce apoptosis (Nair et al., 2014). In some cells, the extrinsic pathway recruits the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to amplify the caspase cascade. These pathways are linked by caspase-8, that triggers the caspase cascade and the protein, Bid (Priante et al., 2019; Alberts et al., 2014). Type I cells act independent of mitochondria for the induction of Fas death receptor-mediated apoptosis, and have therefore optimized the extrinsic pathway. Thymocytes or cells responsible for the immune system in general, for example, are expected to signal each other or target cells through membrane bound ligands, like FasL and TRAIL (Ozoren and El-Deiry, 2002).

The intrinsic pathway is often referred to as the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax and Bak, create pores on the outer mitochondrial membrane, determining the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c. In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to, and stimulates, conformational modifications in the adaptor protein, Apaf-1, thus leading to the enrolment and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 further activates executioner caspases to elicit apoptosis (Priante et al., 2019). Type II cells are mitochondria-dependent, where the mitochondria are crucial to ensure successful apoptosis. For example, liver and kidney cells are responsible for the detoxification of the blood from chemicals toxicants, many of which are cytotoxic and genotoxic agents known to predominantly activate the intrinsic pathway (Ozoren and El-Deiry, 2002).

In a study conducted by Eichler et al. (2006), cultured murine podocytes were incubated for three days with arsenite, cadmiuim, or mercury, as well as an equimolar combination of the three to test the modes and extent of apoptosis induced by the exposure. It was seen that the mix of metal exposure showed significantly fewer apoptotic affects, indicating an antagonistic affect of the metals over an additive or synergistic toxicity. It was also seen that the apoptosis observed in the separate metal tests showed a ~400% increase of caspase 8 activity as well as ~500% upregulation of Fas, factors of the extrinsic pathway. No significant change was seen to the intrinsic pathway factors. The results of this experiment indicate that heavy metals favour extrinsic apoptosis as their method of cytotoxicity.

Necrosis is characterized as passive, accidental cell death resulting from environmental perturbation with uncontrolled release of inflammatory cellular contents (Fink &amp; Cookson, 2005). Contrastingly, apoptosis is an active, intentional, programmed process of autonomous cellular dismantling that avoids eliciting inflammation. These modes would then be categorized into Accidental Cell Death (ACD) and Regulated Cell Death (RCD), respectively fitting necrosis and apoptosis (Choi et al., 2019). Necrosis biochemically manifests through plasma membrane rupture, cell swelling and lysis, energy decline, DAMP release, and emptying of cell contents (Choi et al., 2019; Thiebault et al., 2007). The caspases governing inflammatory cell death, such as necrosis, are caspases-1, -4, -5, -11, -12, -13, and -14 (Fink and Cookson, 2005). Cell fate could be decided by a number of factors. For instance, ATP is required for the execution of apoptosis, so, when lacking, apoptosis is disabled, making the mode of cell death ATP dependent (Shaki et al., 2012). Between apoptosis and necroptosis, cell fate is influenced primarily by the availability of caspase-8 and the cellular or X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP). Thiebault et al. (2007) studied the mechanism of cell mortality induced by uranium in NRK-52E cells and found that after low exposure to uranium (below the CI50 concentration, 500&micro;L), apoptotic cell death was observed, whereas higher exposure to uranium resulted in necrotic cell death. Multiple types of death can be observed simultaneously in tissues exposed to the same stimulus, and the local intensity of a particular stimulus may influence the cell death mechanism (Fink and Cookson, 2005)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/715","Activation, Constitutive androstane receptor","KE 715","The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3) is a nuclear receptor that is expressed primarily in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidneys, intestines and stomach), which can be activated by xenobiotics or by certain endogenous cellular metabolites. CAR normally is tethered in the cytoplasm via a set of specific proteins including heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and other chaperones. Chemical ligands bind to the ligand binding site of CAR, and a conformational change frees CAR from the tethering proteins and facilitates its transport into the nucleus. In addition, indirect CAR activators (e.g. phenobarbital) can bind to the EGF receptor to initiate a series of steps that eventually dephosphorylate a critical Threonine-38 residue in CAR, allowing it to migrate into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, CAR dimerizes with RXR&alpha; and this CAR-RXR complex binds to specific response elements on the DNA to activate transcription of specific CAR-responsive genes. CAR is unique among nuclear receptors, in that it is constitutively active when in the nucleus, i.e. it will spontaneously dimerize with RXR and alter gene expression, even without an activator bound to its ligand binding domain. When activated and translocated to the nucleus, CAR alters the transcription of multiple genes, and it is the altered levels of these gene transcripts (i.e. mRNA levels) that produce the downstream biological effects following activation of CAR (Omiecinski et al., 2011b;  Omiecinski et al., 2011a;  Reschly and Krasowski, 2006;  Swales and Negishi, 2004)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/718","Binding, Tubulin","KE 718","The site of action is the tubulin in the cytoplasm. Tubulins represent a large superfamily, and several isotypes are described for both &alpha; and &beta; tubulin in mammalian cells [Luduena, 2013]. At least six different isotypes of the &alpha; subunit are known, while eight isotypes are known for the &beta; subunit. These subunits share a high degree of homology (90% similarity). In addition to &alpha;- and &beta;-tubulin, other tubulin homologues have been identified (&gamma;, &delta; and &epsilon;), but their roles in the life cycle of the cell are uncertain [Bhattacharya and Cabral, 2009]. All available isotypes are incorporated within microtubules, although with different tissue distributions in normal cells [Berrieman et al., 2004]. The currently known microtubule-disrupting agents bind to all isotypes, having only a slight preference for one over another [Miller et al., 2010]. 

Binding sites on the &alpha;/&beta;-tubulin heterodimer: Conventionally, microtubule-interfering agents are categorized into two main groups: (1) microtubule destabilizers, including colchicine and a variety of vinca alkaloids; and (2) microtubule stabilizers, including taxanes and epothilones. Most agents interact with known binding pockets of &alpha;/&beta;-tubulin; however, there are compounds that bind to tubulin on undefined sites. Three distinct sites are well characterized in the literature [Marchetti et al., 2016; Botta et al., 2009]: (1) the colchicine-binding domain at the interface between the &alpha;- and &beta;-tubulin dimers; (2) the vinca domain surrounding the GTP binding site on &beta;- and &alpha;-tubulin; and, (3) the taxane domain located on &beta;-tubulin [Botta et al., 2009]. 

Colchicine binding domain on tubulin: The colchicine binding domain is a deep pocket located at the &alpha;/&beta; interface of tubulin heterodimers. Crystal structures for tubulin and different ligands are available, although their resolution is not high [Lu et al., 2012; Massarotti et al., 2012]. Notwithstanding its deep location, significant conformational changes in the protein are necessary for accommodating the inhibitors. Both the A and C rings of colchicine are necessary for high affinity binding, while the B ring may only function as a linker between the other two. Three methoxy residues are present in the A ring and all of them are involved in the high affinity binding to tubulin. The C ring of colchicine interacts through van der Waals contacts with Val&alpha;181, Ser&alpha;178, and Val&beta;315. The carbonyl group behaves as a hydrogen bond acceptor, interacting with Val181a. The A ring is buried in a hydrophobic pocket delimited by Lys&beta;352, Asn&beta;350, Leu&beta;378, Ala&beta;316, Leu&beta;255, Lys&beta;254, Ala&beta;250, and Leu&beta;242, and the methoxy group at position 3 is involved in a hydrogen bond interaction within the thiol group of Cys&beta;241 [Marchetti et al., 2016]. Different ligands may compete with colchicine for the same binding site, even in the absence of high structural correspondence [Lu et al., 2012]. 

There is no OECD guideline for measuring chemical binding to tubulin, however, binding of colchicine to tubulin is one of the most studied chemical interactions with biological materials and methodology for its measurement is well established and standardized [Hamel and Lin, 1981; Verdier-Pinard et al., 1998]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/721","Disorganization, Meiotic Spindle","KE 721","The spindle is a cytoskeletal structure present in every eukaryotic cell that must form before cell division in order to properly separate chromosomes between daughter cells [Prosser and Pelletier, 2017]. The spindle organizes itself in a bipolar configuration within the cell prior to cell division. Several hundred proteins are required to assemble a functioning spindle, and microtubules are the most abundant components of the machinery. Although the function of the spindle is similar between mitotic and meiotic cells, spindle formation occurs via distinct mechanisms in female germ cells with respect to other cell types (including male germ cells) [Dumont and Desai, 2012]. This is because spindle formation is generally driven by centrioles, which are lacking in eggs [Szollosi et al., 1972; Manandhar et al., 2005]. The processes in somatic cells and male germ cells versus those operating in oocytes are briefly described below. In this key event, a bipolar spindle configuration is not achieved. Alternatively, there may be some spindle fibers that are not of the appropriate length, shape or structure to ensure that chromosomes can be properly aligned at metaphase and equally distributed between daughter cells.

 

Somatic cells and male germ cells:

The spindle of mitotic cells and that of male germ cells is organized by the centrosome which is composed by a pair of centrioles surrounded by an amorphous pericentriolar material containing more than 100 proteins [Andersen et al., 2003]. Many proteins that are involved in regulating microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) are contained in the centrosome. The centrosome is the principal microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in mammalian cells and plays a major role in controlling microtubule dynamics, nucleation, and kinetochore&ndash;microtubule attachments [Conduit et al., 2015]. Errors in these processes lead to structural and functional abnormalities in the mitotic spindle [Rivera-Rivera and Saavedra, 2016].

Centriole and centrosome duplication are tightly coordinated with DNA replication, mitosis, and cytokinesis and play key roles in regulating transitions through the cell cycle [Chan, 2011]. The centrioles, cylindrical particles composed by nine triplet microtubules [Gogendeau et al., 2015], duplicate by forming daughter centrioles oriented at right angles with respect to the parent centrioles and then become surrounded by separate pericentriolar material during S-phase [Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007]. Before mitosis, the newly formed centrosomes move to the opposite site of the nucleus and originate the two poles of the mitotic spindle [Kellog, 1989; Paintrand et a.l, 1992; Chavali et al., 2012]. Microtubules begin to radiate away from the centrosome and move toward the metaphase plate forming the mitotic spindle. During the assembly of the mitotic spindle, some microtubule fibers attach to the kinetochores on chromosomes, some radiate from the spindle poles toward the cell cortex and others extend past the metaphase plate forming a region of overlap with spindle fibers originating from the opposite centrosome [Cassimeris and Skibbens, 2003; Prosser and Pelletier, 2017]. Although a bipolar spindle can be formed in the absence of centrosomes, having too many centrosomes can result in a morphologically abnormal spindle and increase the chance of chromosome missegration [Hinchcliffe, 2014; Nigg and Holland, 2018].

Oocytes:
In mammalian oocytes, centrioles and centrosomes are absent [Manandhar et al.. 2005] and the meiotic spindle starts its growth from several MTOCs that substitute for the conventional centrosome pair. A mouse oocyte can have up to 80 of these MTOCs [Dumont and Desai, 2012]. These MTOCs gradually coalesce and surround the chromosomes [Schuh and Ellenberg, 2007]. Then, microtubules elongate forming a barrel-shape bipolar spindle. Recent data suggest that MTOCs undergo a three-step decondensation and fragmentation process that facilitate their equal distribution to the spindle poles [Clift and Schuh, 2015]. In addition, recent evidence has shown the presence of actin fibers in the mammalian oocyte spindle that are important for ensuring proper chromosome segregation [Mogessie and Schuh, 2017]. Evidence is also emerging about differences in spindle assembly between rodent and human oocytes. Specifically, human oocytes may lack MTOCs and spindle assembly is mediated by chromosomes and the small guanosine triphosphate Ran [Holubcov&aacute; et al., 2015]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/756","Hippocampal gene expression, Altered","KE 756","Thyroid hormones control genes in the developing brain by classical ligand (T3) activation of thyroid receptors which leads to DNA binding and subsequent transcription and translation (for a review of TH rols in brain development see, Bernal 2015). Gene expression profiles have been published for the developing human and rodent hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2002; Mody et al., 2001). In both humans and rodents, the hippocampus undergoes typical stages of neurodevelopment found in most brain regions, including: cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, synapse formation, and the maturation of synaptic function. In the rodent, peak windows during pre- and post-natal periods have been identified during which major cellular and physiological events occur (see Figure 1). Each window expresses distinct patterns of gene transcription and clusters of genes increase their expression corresponding to the progression of events of hippocampal ontogeny (see Mody et al., 2001).  Tables of gene clusters associated with these phases can be found in Supplementary Tables of Mody et al. (2001).



 

During the very early prenatal period, genes corresponding to general cellular function are prominent (Mody et al., 2001).  These are followed in time by genes regulating neuronal differentiation and migration in the mid to late gestational period. From late gestation (gestational day 15) until birth almost all the cells in the CA fields switch from a highly active proliferation state to a postmitotic state, and then undergo differentiation and migration. Expression of proliferative genes involved in cell cycle progression are highly expressed at gestational day 16, then subsequently are silent immediately after birth when genes directing neuronal growth switch on. The pyramidal neurons of the CA fields in the hippocampus proper develop in advance of the granule cells that comprise the principal cells of the dentate gyrus. As such, the genes controlling the distinct phases of neurodevelopment are expressed at different times in these two hippocampal subregions (Altman and Bayer, 1990a; b). In both subregions, however, many phenotypic changes within the hippocampal neuron occur in the period immediately after birth (postnatal day 1 to 7). Almost all neurons show extensive growth and differentiation during the first postnatal week. These cellular changes are marked by rapid cytoskeletal changes, production of cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix formation. The gene families involved in these processes include actins, tubulins, and chaperonin proteins essential for promoting correct protein folding of cytoskeletal components. Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins are also upregulated during this period as these genes are critical for differentiation and synaptogenesis.

During late postnatal hippocampal development (postnatal day 16-30), hippocampal circuits become more active and exhibit increased synaptic plasticity. Many genes upregulated during this phase of development are involved in synaptic function and include genes regulating vesicle associated proteins and calcium-mediated transmitter release, neurotrophins, and neurotransmitter receptors. Efficient energy utilization is essential during this period of increased synaptic activity, events mirrored by an upregulation of enzymes involved in glucose and oxidative metabolism."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/757","Hippocampal anatomy, Altered","KE 757","The hippocampus is a brain region located in the medial temporal lobe in humans and other mammals (West, 1990). Developmentally it is derived from neuronal and glial cells in the neural tube and differentiates in the proencephalon and telencephalon.  The hippocampus is a cortical structure, but only contains 3-layers, distinct from the 6-layered neocortical structures. For this reason, it is known as archicortex or paleocortex meaning old cortex. In humans, at the macro level, the structure is identified as early as fetal week 13 and continues to mature until 2 to 3 years of age (Kier et al., 1997), with continuing slow growth thereafter until adult ages (Utsunomiya et al., 1999).  In rodents, the hippocampus begins to form in mid-gestation, with the CA fields forming in advance of the dentate gyrus (Altman and Bayer, 1990a; 1990b). The primary structural and functional development of the hippocampus occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy in humans, whereas in rodents, much of the maturation of the CA fields and almost all dentate gyrus occurs in the first 2-3 postnatal weeks.

The structure of the hippocampus has been divided into regions that include CA1 through CA4 and the dentate gyrus. The principal cell bodies of the CA field are pyramidal neurons, those of the dentate gyrus are granule cells.

The major input pathway to the hippocampus is from the layer 2 neurons of the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus via the perforant path forming the first connection of the trisynaptic loop of the hippocampal circuit (Figure 2). Direct afferents from the dentate gyrus (mossy fibers) then synapse on CA3 pyramidal cells which in turn send their axons (Schaeffer Collaterals) to CA1 neurons to complete the trisynaptic circuit. Information from the CA fields then passes through the subiculum entering the fiber pathways of the alveus, fimbria, and fornix and is routed to other areas of the brain (Amaral and Lavenex, 2006). Through the interconnectivity within the hippocampus and its connections to amygdala, septum and cortex, the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in several learning and memory processes, including spatial behaviors. The primary input pathway to the CA regions of the hippocampus is from the septum by way of the fornix and direct input from the amygdala. Reciprocal outputs from the hippocampus back to these regions and beyond also exist. 



Figure 2. Trisynaptic circuit of hippocampal formation. For further details see Amaral and Lavenex, 2006.

At the cellular level, the components of the mammalian hippocampus undergo typical stages of neurodevelopment. With each developmental time window, distinct patterns of gene transcription and protein expression appear, corresponding to cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, synapse formation, and terminal neuronal/glial maturation, culminating in the structural formation of a neuronal network (Mody et al., 2001; Laeremans et al., 2013).  The principal neurons of the CA fields develop in advance of the principal cells of the dentate gyrus and the genes and proteins controlling the distinct phases are expressed at different stages in these two sub-regions (Altman and Bayer, 1990 a, b; Laeremans et al., 2013). In the rodent brain, almost all neurons show extensive growth and differentiation on axons and dendrites during the first postnatal week. These cellular changes are marked by rapid protein expression specific for different neuronal and glial subtypes including cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. cofilin, actins, tubulins etc..), production of cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix formation which are critical structural elements of a neuronal network.

As neurons mature, they extend dendritic processes that lengthen and branch, the ends of which broaden to form a spine head. Dendritic spines form the postsynaptic structural component of most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain, including hippocampus. The spine head has a greater potential for connectivity and synapse formation (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Fiala et al., 1998; Hardy, LR and Redmond, 2008, Pfeiffer et al., 2018).   The postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) is one of the key proteins involved in dendritic spine maturation, clustering of synaptic signalling proteins, and ultimately mediating synaptic transmission. It also plays a critical role in regulating dendrite outgrowth and branching and formation dendritic spines.

As the hippocampus matures during the postnatal period hippocampal circuits become more active and exhibit increased activity-dependent plasticity. Many genes and proteins are upregulated during this phase of development, especially molecules involved in the axon guidance (e.g. BDNF/CREB) (Hinkemeyer et al., 2003; Shen and Cowan., 2010), dendritic spine formation (e.g. Neuroligin, Ephrins) and synaptogenesis. Increased expression of vesicle associated proteins (e.g., SNAP-25), synaptic vesicle proteins (e.g., synaptophysin, synapsin I) and proteins involved in sodium and calcium-mediated transmitter release occurs during this period. These changes are accompanied by a parallel increase in neurotrophins and neurotransmitters, receptors and ion channels (Sudhof, 2018; Zhong et al., 2020; Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008).  Therefore, any alterations in the expression of these proteins (Figure 3) may result in changes of synapse formation, followed by alteration of neuronal networks within the hippocampus. 



Figure 3. The main structural components of the synapse: (A) a presynaptic and a postsynaptic neuron, separated by a synaptic cleft; (B) the dendritic spines and (C) the proteins involved in synaptic formation and transmission, including synaptic vesicle (SV), presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins present in excitatory and inhibitory synapse. Adapted from Serrano et al., 2022.

The dendritic spine represents the primary site of synaptic activity at the postsynaptic site. A variety of proteins present in the presynaptic terminal and the postsynaptic dendritic spine are expressed at different times during synaptogenesis, perturbation of which can negatively impact synaptic formation and structure at the macro- and ultra- structural level.

The use of genetically modified mouse models has been widely applied to delineate a host of different proteins involved in the structural development of the hippocampus (Joo et al., 2020). With this approach, changes in neuronal morphology, synapse and network formation in the hippocampus are contrasted in animals lacking this protein vs &lsquo;wild type&rsquo; mice where the protein has been maintained. These comparisons have adopted a variety of techniques, several described below. In KE4, differential expression of proteins identified in these model systems is taken as evidence of altered structure.

However, it is essential to consider the timing of events during development, when their detection is optimal (Hevner, 2007; Garman et al., 2001; Zgraggen et al., 2012). Some macrolevel structural changes may be transient yet still significantly impact downstream events. In the case of knockout models, it is also important to recognize that in most cases, the protein has been removed for the entire lifespan of the animal, in the brain and elsewhere in the body, a scenario distinct from a chemical perturbation."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/758","Hippocampal Physiology, Altered","KE 758","The hippocampus functions as a highly integrated and organized communication and information processing network with millions of interconnections among its constitutive neurons. Neurons in the hippocampus and throughout the brain transmit and receive information largely through chemical transmission across the synaptic cleft, the space where the specialized ending of the presynaptic axon terminus of the transmitting neuron meets the specialized postsynaptic region of the neuron that is receiving that information (Kandell et al., 2012).

During development (see KE 657: Hippocampal anatomy, Altered), as neurons reach their final destination and extend axonal processes, early patterns of electrical synaptic activity emerge in the hippocampus. These are large fields of axonal innervation of broad synaptic target sites that are replaced by more elaborate, but highly targeted and refined axonal projections and synaptic connectivity brought about by activity-dependent synaptic stabilization, pruning, or synapse elimination.  This is a classic case of the interaction between physiological and anatomical development, where anatomy develops first, and is &lsquo;reshaped&rsquo; by physiological function (Kutsarova et al., 2017).

In the rat, excitatory processes are fully mature in area CA1 of hippocampus within 2 weeks of birth with inhibitory processes lagging begin by several weeks (Muller et al., 1989; Michelson and Lothman, 1988; Harris and Teyler, 1984). In hippocampal slices, inhibitory function in area CA1 field is first seen on postnatal day 5, increasing in strength at postnatal day 12 through 15.  In vivo studies fail to detect inhibition until postnatal day 18 with steady increase thereafter to adult levels by postnatal day 28. Synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) is absent in the very young animal, only emerging about postnatal day 14, appearing to require the stability of both excitatory and inhibitory function to be established (Muller et al., 1989; Bekenstein and Lothman, 1991). These features of the maturation of hippocampal physiology are paralleled in dentate gyrus, but as with anatomical indices in the rat, the development of these physiological parameters lag behind the CA1 by about 1 week. As described in structural development in KE4, a very similar pattern of maturation occurs in the human developing hippocampus, but with a trajectory that is largely complete before birth."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/79","Inhibition, Cyclooxygenase activity","KE 79","Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS; KEGG ID E.C. 1.14.99.1; [1]) is an enzyme that has two catalytic sites. Cyclooxygenase site (COX) catalyzes conversion of arachidonic acid into endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (Simmons et al., 2004). Peroxidase active site converts PGG2 to PGH2 (KEGG reactions 1599, 1590, [2]). PGH2 is a precursor for synthesis of other prostaglandins (e.g., PGEs, PGFs; [3]), prostacyclin and thromboxanes (Simmons et al., 2004; Botting and Botting 2011). Two of the COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) encoded by two different genes (ptgs1 and ptgs2) are well characterized. Ptgs1 is typically expressed constitutively and is involved in maintenance of homeostatic functions. Ptgs2 is largely inducible (e.g., by inflammation, during discrete stages of gamete maturation etc.), but can also be constitutively expressed (e.g., kidney; Green et al, 2012). In mammals, COX-3 (a splice of COX-1) has also been identified (Chandrasekharan et al., 2002), but its function is not well characterized and it is not likely to have prostaglandin producing capacity (Bacchi et al., 2012). 
Most COX inhibitors interfere with COX site via competitive inhibition (compete for active site with arachidonic acid), but some are capable of covalent modification of COX (Simmons et al., 2004; Willoughby et al., 2011). The inhibition of COX can lead to reduced efficiency of converting arachidonic acid to PGG2. Therefore inhibition of COX can decrease the rate of prostaglandin production (reviewed Simmons et al, 2004; Bacchi et al., 2012)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/814","Occurrence, Kidney toxicity","KE 814","The kidneys are a crucial site of regulation of divalent cation levels in the plasma through filtration, reabsorption, and concentration (cite). On top of their excretion capabilities, the kidneys are also responsible for the production of hormones crucial for hematologic, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle homeostasis (Bonventre et al., 2010). Nephrons are the functional units of the kidney and each kidney is made up of approximately 1 million nephrons (Bonventre et al., 2010). The nephrons are vital in reabsorption of these cations where 70% of transport has been shown to occur in the proximal tubule (Barbier et al., 2005). The kidneys are thought to be very susceptible to toxicity due to the increased concentration through their filtering structures with the tubular uptake mechanisms, specifically those of the proximal tubule, magnifying intracellular concentrations (Bonventre et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2017). Commonly, biomarkers like serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are utilized to identify kidney toxicity; however, these markers have been identified as nonspecific to the area of the kidney and slow in identification. Bonventre et al. (2010) has explored other biomarkers that may be used to identify segment specific injury. Proximal tubule injury can be identified using: albumin, RPB, NAG, clusterin, osteopontin, a1-microglobulin, and many others. Glomerulus damage can be identified through urinary Cystatin C, b2-microglobulin, a1-microglobulin, albumin, and more (Bonventre et al., 2010). These biomarkers do show some overlap between regions and can indicate damage to various areas of the nephron, though it is important to note the development of these specific techniques and therefore, the ability to develop more tailored and earlier identifying testing procedures. 

Since there are many essential metals for cellular function, there are also many transporters responsible for facilitating ionic entry into the cell and the designated cellular compartment (cite). Some of these transporters are very specific to a given metal and some are more diverse in the metals they handle, therefore, these transporters can facilitate the transport of toxic metals into the cell, often through mimickery exhibited by those metals (Ballatori, 2002). DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1) is a strong example of such transporters. The introduction of toxic divalent cations (Cd2+, Pb2+, Pt2+, etc.) is highly problematic in the kidneys due to increased toxicity and occupancy of DMT1 limiting the transport of essential trace elements. DMT1 is an essential transport molecule that is highly expressed in the kidneys, and is responsible for transport of essential trace divalent cations, as well as highly toxic ones; this competition increases strain on the kidneys exposed to toxic heavy metals (Barbier et al., 2005; Ballatori, 2002). DMT1 has been shown to transport Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb via a proton-coupled, membrane potential dependant mechanism (Ballatori, 2002). Some toxic metals can also enter a cell by forming complexes that mimic endogenous molecules in their structure. Arsenate and vanadate, for example, act as phosphate mimics both for transport and metabolism, assaulting cellular function by the same mechanism as their initial entry; cromate, selenite and molybdate mimic sulfate in a similar way (Ballatori, 2002). Many of the identified transporters fooled by this mimicry have been localized to the brush border membrane of the renal proximal tubule and epithelial cells. Some divalent metals such as Cd, Ba, and Sr have been shown to enter cells through voltage gated calcium channels. Another important example focused on by Ballatori (2002) is the action of inorganic mercury and methyl mercury (MeHg) that were shown to have high affinity for reduced sulfhydryl groups. These groups are seen on the amino acid cysteine, and importantly on glutathione (GSH), a vital enzymatic antioxidant. MeHg mimics methionine to enter the cell, after which it binds to GSH, and interferes with ATP production (Ballatori, 2002). Uranium has been shown to enter the blood rapidly and then either form stable complexes with plasma proteins, due to its high affinity for phosphate, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, or binds to bicarbonate in the blood (Keith et al., 2013). In the kidneys, uranium can be released from bicarbonate to combine with other small proteins in the kidney tubular walls, disrupting cellular function (Keith et al., 2013). Uranium has been seen to enter the glomerulus, where it is filtered, via endocytosis as UO+2 binding to anionic sites of proximal tubular epithelial brush borders (Shaki et al., 2012). 

To further understand the mode of action of heavy metals within the kidneys, many studies have been conducted to determine the specific region primarily damaged. It is also important to note that variation of results may be found in some studies as experimental conditions as well as other factors may influence the mode of action of some metals. Zamora et al. (1998) found that kidney function decrease and cytotoxicity increase were correlated with uranium ingestion. However, no glomerular injury was detected, indicating that chronic uranium ingestion in rats (0.004 &micro;g/kg to 9 &micro;g/kg body weight) damages the proximal tubule and not the glomerulus (Zamora et al., 1998). Homma-Takeda et al. (2013) identifies the kidneys as the major site of depleted uranium toxicity. Studying the kidneys of rats of varying ages, exposed to 0.1-2mg/kg uranyl acetate, they found that the younger kidneys did not flush the uranium out as well. Accumulation of uranium and its damages was seen in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules (Homma-Takeda et al., 2013). Shaki et al. (2012), assessed the mechanism of depleted uranium-induced nephrotoxicity that revealed damage to the mitochondria isolated from uranyl acetate treated rat kidney cells. The damage included oxidative stress, mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, cytochrome C release, impaired ATP production, and damage to the electron transport chain complexes. Utilizing rat renal brush border vesicles, Goldman et al. (2006) found that exposure to uranyl acetate induced decreased rates of glucose transport, in part due to a decreased number of sodium-coupled glucose transporters; this decreased the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb glucose properly. Berradi et al. (2008) assessed the red blood cell (RBC) count of rats drinking water containing 40mg DU/L and found that chronic exposure to DU causes RBC reduction, pointing to nephrotoxicity as the kidneys play a major role in RBC synthesis. Heavy metals consistently aggregate in the kidneys, and more specifically in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules. Evidence also suggests that uranium and other heavy metals induce nephrotoxicity after endocytosis into cells by disrupting the electron transport chain, inducing oxidative stress. The oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction followed by, apoptosis at low doses of uranium and necrosis at  high doses of uranium. Finally, this induces renal injury and tissue damage to the proximal tubules, or nephrotoxicity."

Uptake of the hapten-protein complex formed during covalent binding by keratinocytes activates multiple events, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-18) and the induction of cyto-protective cellular pathways. Hapten-protein complexes can activate the inflammasome ([1];[2]) and in so doing induce IL-18 production. Activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 results from cleavage of inactive IL-18 precursor protein by inflammasome-associated caspase-1[3]. Intracellular Nod-like receptors (NLR) contain sensors for a number of cellular insults. Upon activation, NLRs oligomerise form molecular complexes (i.e. inflammasomes) that are involved in the activation of inflammatory-associated caspases, including caspase-1. Induction of intracellular levels of IL-18 exhibit responses upon exposure to hapten-protein complexes which can be used to establish potency[4]. Keratinocyte exposure to allergens also results in induction of antioxidant/electrophile response element ARE/EpRE-dependent pathways[5]. Briefly, reactive chemicals bind to Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associates protein 1) that normally inhibit the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Released Nrf2 interacts with other nuclear proteins and binds to and activates ARE/EpREdependent pathways, including the cytoprotective genes NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase (GSHST), among others ([5];[6])."

A sensitised subject has the capacity to mount a more accelerated secondary response to the same chemical. Upon reaching an unknown threshold number of hapten-specific T cells an individual will be said to be sensitised and will elicit a T cell-mediated eczematous skin reaction (termed allergic contact dermatitis, ACD) at the site of sensitiser re-exposure. Above the threshold, the severity of the adverse effect is assumed to increase proportionally to the dose, so the total dose per area of skin (e.g. μg/cm2) is the critical exposure determinant. In this regard, animal data is consistent with human clinical data[1].       
The allergic reaction causes inflammation of the skin manifested by varying degrees of erythema, oedema, and vesiculation. It takes up to one week or more for individuals to develop specific sensitivity to a new allergen following exposure. An individual who never has been sensitised to a substance may develop only a mild dermatitis 2 weeks following the initial exposure but typically develops severe dermatitis within 1-2 days of the second and subsequent exposures[2]."

Uroporphyrinogen III is the first cyclic metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of heme. Under normal conditions, it is converted into coproporphyrinogen III by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), and subsequently processed to heme following three further steps[1]. In the event that UROD activity is reduced (due to genetic disorders or chemical inhibition) uroporphyrinogen III, and other porphyrinogen substrates of UROD, are oxidized to highly stable porphyrins, which accumulation and lead to a heme disorder known as porphyria (Figure 1)[2]."

Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) is the fifth enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway and catalyzes the step-wise conversion of uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen. Each of the four acetic acid substituents is decarboxylated in sequence with the consequent formation of hepta-, hexa-, and pentacarboxylic porphyrinogens as intermediates[1]. Impairment of this enzyme, either due to heterozygous mutations in the UROD gene or chemical inhibition of the UROD protein, leads to accumulation of uroporphyrins (and other highly carboxylated porphyrins)[2], which are normally only present in trace amounts."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/851","Decrease of GABAergic interneurons","KE 851","Biological state

The GABA-mediated depolarizing effects at the post-synaptic neurons in early development are well documented (Ben-Ari, 2014) and have been greatly correlated with the emergence of spontaneous network activity, which is the first neuronal activity of the brain (Voigt et al., 2001; Opitz et al., 2002). This spontaneous network activity is characterized by synchronous bursts of action potentials and concomitant intracellular calcium transients in large group of cells and it has been proposed to have functional role during the synaptogenesis and the formation of connections within the neuronal network (Wang and Kriegstein, 2010; Ben Ari et al., 2007; Blankenship and Feller, 2010).

One of the milestones at the critical stage of brain development is the switch of the GABAergic signalling from depolarizing early in life to a more conventional hyperpolarizing inhibition on maturation (Ben-Ari et al., 2007). This developmental GABAergic switch is mainly driven by the expression change of the predominant potassium-chloride co-transporters (KCC2 and NKCC1) around this period that results in a shift from high to low intracellular Cl&minus; concentration at the post-synaptic neurons (Lu et al., 1999).

Biological compartments

GABAergic interneurons are a heterogeneous group of neuronal cells that consist only of 10 to 20% of the total neuronal population (Aika et al., 1994; Halasy and Somogyi, 1993). They are characterized by aspiny dendrites and the release of GABA neurotransmitter, which makes them the main inhibitory source in the adult central nervous system (CNS) (Markram et al., 2004). A hallmark of interneurons is their structural and functional diversity. Many different subtypes have been identified in the cortex and hippocampus, but a global classification in specific categories is difficult to be established due to the variable morphological and functional properties (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008; DeFelipe et al., 2013). The interneurons can be primarily identified by their characteristic morphology, which would divide them into 4 basic groups: basket cells, chandelier cells, bouquet cells and bitufted cells. However, a broader classification of these cells would require at least the following criteria: 1) morphology of soma, axonal and dendritic arbors; 2) molecular markers including but not restricted to calcium binding proteins (parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin) and neuropeptides (e.g., Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide [VIP], reelin, somatostatin); 3) postsynaptic target cells; and 4) functional characteristics (Ascoli et al., 2008). They are neither motor nor sensory neurons, and also differ from projection neurons which send their signals to more distant locations.

GABAergic interneurons are broadly present throughout the CNS, although telencephalic structures, such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, show the most abundant quantities of this neurotransmitter (Jones 1987). Complex interconnections between GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells shape the responses of pyramidal cells to incoming inputs, prevent runaway excitation, refine cortical receptive fields, and are involved in the timing and synchronisation of network oscillations (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Markram et al., 2004; LeMaqueresse and Monyer, 2013; Hu et al., 2014).

General role in biology

Inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the adult nervous system play a vital role in neural circuitry and activity by regulating the firing rate of target neurons (reducing neuronal excitability). In vertebrates, GABA acts at inhibitory synapses in the brain by binding to specific transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal processes. Released neurotransmitter typically acts through postsynaptic GABAA ionotropic receptors in order to trigger a neuronal signalling pathway. This binding causes the opening of ion channels to allow the flow of either negatively charged chloride ions into the cell or positively charged potassium ions out of the cell. This action results in a negative change in the transmembrane potential, usually causing hyperpolarization.

During early brain development GABA mediates depolarisation that has recently been shown to promote excitatory synapse formation by facilitating NMDA receptor activation in cortical pyramidal neurons (Wang and Kriegstein, 2008). GABAergic signalling has the unique property of &quot;ionic plasticity&quot;, which is dependent on short-term and long-term concentration changes of Cl- and HCO3- in the postsynaptic neurons. The intracellular ion concentrations are largely modified in the course of brain development corresponding to the operation and functional modulation of ion transporters, such as the K-Cl co-transporter 2 (KCC2) and the Na-K-Cl co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) (Blaesse et al., 2009; Blankenship and Feller, 2010).

GABA plays an important role as the first excitatory transmitter during embryogenesis and it has been shown to affect neurogenesis, differentiation, migration, and integration of developing neurons into neuronal circuits (LoTurco et al., 1995; Heck, et al., 2007).

The effects of GABA being depolarizing are also important in the adult brain, as it has impact on synaptic plasticity and is strongly correlated with seizures (Baram and Hatalski, 1998; Ben-Ari et al., 2012). If GABAergic interneuron function breaks down, excitation takes over, leading to seizures and failure of higher brain functions (Westbrook, 2013)"

Indirectly, the inhibition of apoptosis in either damaged or initiated cells favors their survival, and inhibition of apoptosis af- fords initiated cells an increased opportunity for clonal expansion and autonomous growth with the chance to acquire additional mutations during the process of tumor progression. AHR activation inhibits apoptosis in altered hepatic foci (i.e., initiated hepatic cells), and this inhibition affords cells within altered hepatic foci a sur- vival advantage and increases the likelihood that these cells will acquire additional mutations."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/854","Alterations, Cellular proliferation / hyperplasia","KE 854","Over the time period of high levels of sustained AHR activation, DLCs produce a complex pattern of cell proliferative responses. Teeguarden et al. (1999) observed that rats initiated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and then dosed with either 0.1 or 1 ng/ kg-d TCDD for one month exhibited a reduced labeling index relative to controls, and reduced BrdU-labeling was also observed following the 0.1 ng/kg-d TCDD dose after three months. Maronpot et al. (1993) observed a reduction in BrdU labeling index in hepatocytes at a low dose of 3.5 ng/kg-d TCDD in DEN-initiated rats after 30 weeks of TCDD administration but, at a dose of 125 ng/kg/d the labeling index was increased.
Both parenchymal calls and liver stem cells are likely involved in the organ-level response to sustained AHR activation. Early acti- vation of the AHR in zone 3 of the liver acinus causes decreased hepatocyte replication and may act as an indirect proliferative stimulus for stem cells and hepatoblasts (Andersen et al., 1997; Conolly and Andersen, 1997; Tritscher et al., 1992). Oval cells in the periportal region likely function as a source of replacement of hepatocytes after inhibition of normal hepatocyte replication- replacement (Paku et al., 2001; Sahin et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2003). While hepatocyte replication is considered the normal means for replacement of liver parenchyma, inhibition of hepatocyte replication in centrilobular regions induced by TCDD may induce normally quiescent liver stem cells to proliferate.
Following longer period of sustained AHR activation, organ- level increases in cell proliferation ensue, demonstrated by an in- crease in BrdU labeling and likely reflecting the regenerative response to organ-wide toxicity (Hailey et al., 2005).
Non-parenchymal cells, including stem cells, hepatoblasts, biliary cells, stellate cells, endothelial cells, and Kuppfer cells, play a role in this AOP. In rodents, TCDD elicits a fibrogenic and bile duct proliferative response that requires pathological alteration of stellate cell function and increased differentiation and growth of hepatoblasts and bile duct cells before 33 weeks of exposure. Retinoid depletion induces stellate cell proliferation, production of extracellular matrix components, and the transition to fibroblast; stellate cells maintain vitamin A homeostasis and respond to liver injury with formation of proliferative cytokines such as TGF-a and EGF (Friedman, 2008; Pintilie et al., 2010; Senoo et al., 2010). TCDD induces loss of retinoid content (presumably from stellate cells) and may disrupt the extensive communication between various liver cell types (Fletcher et al., 2001; Hoegberg et al., 2005; Pierre et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2003). Thus, TCDD-induced retinol loss from hepatic stellate cells may contribute to cell proliferation, biliary fibrosis, and cholangiolarcarcinoma (Fattore et al., 2000; Friedman, 2008; Hakansson and Hanberg, 1989; Schmidt et al., 2003).
AHR activation also induces changes in stem/oval cells. All of the rats receiving 100 ng/kg/day TCDD, the highest dose group animals in the 2-year cancer bioassay, developed oval cell hyperplasia with clear statistical increases in this endpoint at 22 ng/kg/day or greater (Hailey et al., 2005).
Evidence points to the involvement of TNF-alpha regulation in the proliferative response of hepatic stem cells; this is likely mediated through modulation of the levels of TNF-alpha, altered beta-catenin signaling, and inhibition of cell-to-cell contact (Knight et al., 2000; Umannova et al., 2007; Vondracek et al., 2009; Dietrich et al., 2002; Prochazkova et al.,2011; Weiss et al., 2008). TNF-alpha is an inflammatory cytokine with an important role in liver tumor promotion.

Adenomas may arise from altered hepatic foci that are derived from hepato- cytes or hepatoblasts whereas hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas likely arise from initiated stem cells.

Fatty acids serve as the natural ligands that stimulate PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling where the fatty acids (likely in association with fatty acid binding proteins) bind to the ligand binding domain of PPAR&alpha; along with co-activators to the PPAR&alpha; regulatory complex at promoter regions of PPAR&alpha;-regulated genes (termed PPAR response elements, PPREs) initiating the transcription of genes that metabolize the fatty acids (Ahmed et al 2007, Wolfrum et al. 2001, Desvergne and Wahli 1999, Kersten 2014, Xu et al 2001, Janssen et al 2015). 

 

Specifically, PPAR&alpha; contains both a ligand-binding domain that binds fatty acids and a DNA-binding domain that initiates binding to PPREs in the promoter regions of PPAR&alpha;-regulated genes (Ahmed et al 2007, Hihi et al 2002).  Binding of the fatty acid ligands to PPAR&alpha; facilitates heterodimeric binding with another ligand-activated nuclear receptor, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), forming an activated PPAR-RXR transcriptional regulator complex (DiRenzo et al 1997, Ahmed et al 2007).  PPAR competes for binding to RXR with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) where the RAR/RXR heterodimer inhibits transcription of genes downstream of PPREs (DiRenzo et al 1997).  Transcriptional regulation activity of the PPAR/RXR complex is also influenced by the binding and release of accessory molecules that act as coactivators such as steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1) or as corepressors such as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR, DiRenzo et al 1997, Ahmed et al 2007, Xu et al 2002, Liu et al 2008).  Such binding of the co-repressor N-CoR to the PPAR&alpha;/RXR&alpha; complex has been demonstrated to inhibit transcriptional transactivation (Xu et al 2002, Liu et al 2008).  The exact mechanisms by which the PPAR/RXR complex facilitate transcription are still not well understood.  It has been observed that RXR contains a highly conserved motif at the C-terminal end of the ligand-binding domain known as activating function 2 (AF2) which undergoes conformational changes allowing interaction with coactivators / corepressors, the former of which is hypothesized to recruit the components of the transcriptional machinery necessary to transcribe the downstream gene (DiRenzo et al 1997).  Even the basal transcriptional machinery itself is recognized to vary across cell types and the prototypical preinitiation complex (PIC) is inherently highly flexible, confirmationally diverse including multi-faceted interactions of activators, core promotion factors, the RNA polymerase II enzyme, elongation factors, and chromatin remodeling complexes all combined at the promoter to facilitate gene transcription (Levine et al 2014).  Additionally, recent transcriptomic research coupling transcriptomic expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing to identify PPAR&alpha; binding to PPREs suggests PPAR&alpha; may exert transcriptional regulation beyond its direct genomic targets via secondary signaling networks including various kinases (McMullen et al 2014).  Given the current KE (KE2, PPARalpha transactivation of gene expression, Decreased), a variety of upstream influences may impair the function of the PPAR&alpha;-RXR&alpha; heterodimer and/or affect coactivator / corepressor binding leading to decreased PIC competence resulting in impaired transcription of downstream genes as well as secondary signaling networks.

 

PPAR&alpha; regulates expression of genes encoding nearly every enzymatic step of fatty acid catabolism including fatty acid uptake into cells, fatty acid activation to acyl-CoAs, and the release of cellular energy from fatty acids through the oxidative breakdown of acyl-CoAs to acetyl-CoA, and in starvation conditions, the repackaging of Acetyl-CoA substrates into ketone bodies via ketogenesis pathways (Kersten 2014, Desvergne and Wahli 1999, Evans et al 2004).  A pathway-level schematic for PPAR&alpha; transactivation is illustrated in KEGG Pathway map03320 providing the specific gene targets and associated functional responses that are transcriptionally regulated by PPAR&alpha;. It should be noted that there are species-specific differences in PPAR&alpha; transactivation of gene expression among mice and humans which are explained in the &ldquo;Evidence Supporting Taxonomic Applicability&rdquo; section, below."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/861","Decreased, Ketogenesis (production of ketone bodies)","KE 861","PPAR&alpha; acts as a transcriptional activator for many of the genes involved in ketogenesis (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014).  Thus, decreased PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling results in decreased transcriptional expression of genes that are regulated by PPAR&alpha;, and subsequently, decreased expression of the coded proteins and enzymes that ultimately impair ketogenesis.  Ketogenesis is critical to supporting general systemic energy homeostasis in fasting events (Cahill 2006, Evans et al 2004, Sengupta et al 2010), thus KE4 becomes important after short term energy stores (glycogen) become limited (Muoio et al 2002).  Le May et al (2000) have shown decreased ketogenesis  in livers of PPAR null mice linked to impaired mitochondrial hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (Hmgcs) gene expression.

Genes Involved:  Not only does PPAR&alpha; regulate the genes that catalyze the upstream production of the raw materials utilized in ketogenesis through fatty acid beta-oxidation (see decreased peroxisomal (KE3) and mitochondrial (KE4) fatty acid beta oxidation, upstream), but also directly induces key enzymes in the ketogenesis pathway including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A synthase 2 (Hmgcs2), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (Hmgcl), and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (Acat1, Kersten et al 2014, Le May et al 2000). PPAR&alpha; is recognized as the master transcriptional activator of ketogenic genes (Sengupta et al 2010, Desvergne and Wahli 1999).

 

Metabolism Affected:  The liver plays a key role in processing the fundamental energy substrate, acetyl-CoA, into metabolic currencies that contribute to the systemic cellular energy needs of the whole organism.  The liver represents a key organ involved in systemic energy distribution given its ability to synthesize glucose (an ability shared only with the kidney, Gerich et al 2001) as well as its exclusive role in the generation of ketone bodies (Cahill 2006, Sengupta et al 2010, Kersten 2014).  This is especially important for the metabolic energy needs of the brain which can only use glucose and the ketone body, &beta;-hydroxybutyrate for cellular energy production (Cahill 2006, Owen 2005, Kersten 2014).  Therefore, ketogenesis is critical to supporting general systemic energy homeostasis in fasting events (Cahill 2006, Evans et al 2004, Sengupta et al 2010).  Interference with ketogenesis, for example by PPAR&alpha; inhibition, has been demonstrated to inhibit &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production (measured in serum) during fasting events in mice (Le May et al 2000, Badman et al 2007, Potthoff 2009, Sengupta et al 2010) and cause hypoketonemia (Muoio et al 2002).  The Badman et al (2007) study indicated that metabolism of fatty acid substrates (measured as liver triglycerides) that would otherwise contribute to &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production was additionally inhibited under PPAR&alpha; knockout.  

In a fasting state, humans transition from the use of exogenous glucose to glucose derived from glycogen within 4 hours with a steadily increasing proportion of glucose usage that is derived from gluconeogenesis up to 2 days (Cahill 2006).  Beyond 2 days of fasting, ketone body production (&beta;-hydroxybutyrate) increasingly supports the energy demands of the brain (Cahill 2006)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/864","Decreased, Body Weight","KE 864","If caloric intake is less than caloric use over time, an individual will lose body weight.  This is a basic principle in human dieting as well as an important principle related to individual health and ecological fitness of animal populations.   Dynamic energy budget theory has provided useful insights on how organisms take up, assimilate and then allocate energy to various fundamental biological processes including maintenance, growth, development and reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000).  Regarding energy allocation, somatic maintenance must first be met before then growth may occur, followed by maturation and then finally, surplus energy is dedicated to reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000).  As an example of the importance of energy allocation to ecological fitness, a review by Martin et al (1987) demonstrated that energy availability (availability of food) was the predominant limiting factor in reproductive success and survival for both young and parents in a broad life history review  for bird species.  This is a likely scenario for many organisms.

Various physiological processes act to maintain and prioritize energy allocations in individuals.  The influence of PPARalpha on systemic energy metabolism and energy homeostasis has been broadly established (see reviews by Kersten 2014, Evans et al 2004, Desvergne and Wahli 1999).  Inhibition of PPARalpha predominantly impairs lipid metabolism with respect to overall energy metabolism whereby energy release from fatty acid substrates is decreased.  PPARalpha has been demonstrated to play a critical role in stimulating fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis during fasting resulting in increased ketone body levels in plasma (Badman et al 2007, Kersten 2014) a response that is eliminated in PPARalpha knockout mice (Badman et al 2007, Sanderson et al 2010).   Reviews by Cahill (2006) and Wang et al (2010) summarize the critical adaptive response of ketogenesis during fasting for maintaining systemic energy homeostasis by providing ketone bodies to energetically fuel a diverse range of tissues, especially the brain.   Not only does PPARalpha induce the upstream production of the raw materials for use in ketogenesis through fatty acid beta-oxidation, but also directly induces key enzymes in the ketogenesis pathway including Hmgcs2, Hmgcl and Acat1 (Kersten 2014).

Kersten et al (1999) and Badman et al (2007) demonstrated that PPARalpha-null mice were unable to actively mobilize fatty acid oxidation, and further, Kersten et al (1999) demonstrated that these mice were unable to meet energy demands during fasting and leading to hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypoketonemia and fatty liver.   Observations from toxicological and toxicogenomic research have implicated nitrotoluenes as potential PPAR antagonists in birds (Rawat et al 2010), rats (Deng et al 2011) and mice (Wilbanks et al 2014), an effect that additionally corresponded with weight loss in rats (Wilbanks et al 2014) and weight loss, loss of muscle mass and emaciation in birds (Quinn et al 2007).  These combined results indicate that inhibition of PPARalpha signaling and the resultant decrease in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis can detrimentally impair systemic energy budgets leading to starvation-like effects and resultant weight loss.  As reviewed in the introductory paragraph of this adverse outcome description, impaired energy availability leading to inability to meet somatic maintenance needs and causing negative growth are likely to have detrimental effects on survivorship, reproduction and ecological fitness. Such affects may adversely affect responses of regulatory concern including:  individual health, survival, and population sustainability."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/87","Release, Cytokine","KE 87","Cytokines are small, soluble molecules secreted by cells to enable intercellular communication. Cytokines may act on the cells that secrete them (autocrine action), on nearby cells (paracrine action), as well as on distant cells (endocrine action). Cytokines can act synergistically or antagonistically, and secretion from one cell can trigger upregulation of a further range of cytokines from the same cell or others [1]. Most cells in the body are able to secrete them, and several subfamilies belong to the group of cytokines, such as chemokines, interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factors (TNF), transforming growth factors (TGF) and colony-stimulating factors. They are important players in modulating fundamental biological processes, including body growth, adiposity, lactation, hematopoiesis, and also inflammation and immunity[2]. Damaged cells, such as apoptotic cells, can trigger the upregulation and release of cytokines to induce the inflammatory response. An important receptor responsible for cell death-related cytokine regulation is Fas, a cell surface glycoprotein which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. The role of Fas in the onset of inflammation by upregulating inflammatory cytokines is increasingly discussed. Fas-activation can trigger the production of MCP-1 and IL-8 and its associated chemotaxis of phagocytes toward apoptotic cells[3].
TNF-α is an inflammatory mediator that can be secreted by many cell types, including hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. TNF-induced cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, GMCSF, CXCL1, and RANTES, can trigger immune responses by producing acute phase proteins and recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and basophils to the site of inflammation. Moreover, an increased production of monocytes/macrophages from bone marrow is triggered[3]. 
On the other hand, inflammation can be suppressed by cytokines and mediators such as IL-10 and TGF-β. In the liver, TGF-β1 is the most abundant isoform and is secreted by immune cells, stellate cells, and epithelial cells. IL-10 inhibits T cell-, monocyte-, and macrophage-mediated functions and has been detected in several liver cells, in¬cluding hepatocytes, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells [2]."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/870","Increase, Cell Proliferation","KE 870","Throughout their life, cells replicate their organelles and genetic information before dividing to form two new daughter cells, in a process known as cellular proliferation. This replicative process is known as the cell cycle and is subdivided into various stages notably, G1, S, G2, and M in mammals. G1 and G2 are gap phases, separating mitosis and DNA synthesis. Differentiated cells typically remain in G1; however, quiescent cells reside in an optional phase just before G1, known as G0.  

Progression through the cycle is dependent on sufficient nutrient availability to provide optimal nucleic acid, protein, and lipid levels, as well as sufficient cell mass. To this end, the cell cycle is mediated by three major checkpoints: the restriction (R) point, or G1/S checkpoint, controlling entry into S phase, the G2/M checkpoint, controlling entry into mitosis, and one more controlling entry into cytokinesis. If conditions are ideal for division, cells will pass the restriction point (G1/S) and begin the activation and expression of genes used for duplicating centrosomes and DNA, eventually leading to proliferation (Cuy&agrave;s et al., 2014).  

Various protein complexes, known as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) regulate passage through each phase by activating and inhibiting specific processes (Lovicu et al., 2014). The CDKs are responsible for controlling progression through the cell cycle. They promote DNA synthesis and mitosis, and therefore cell division (Barnum &amp; O&rsquo;Connell, 2014). Furthermore, growth factors are required to stimulate cell division, but after passing through the restriction point at G1 they are no longer necessary (Lovicu et al., 2014).  

In the context of cancer, one hallmark is the sustained and uncontrolled cell proliferation (Hanahan et al., 2011, Portt et al., 2011). When cells obtain a growth advantage due to mutations in critical genes that regulate cell cycle progression, they may begin to proliferate excessively, resulting in hyperplasia and potentially leading to the development of a tumor. This is often achieved through oncogene activation and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (Hanahan et al., 2011). Cell inactivation and the replacement of these cells can initiate clonal expansion (Heidenreich adn Paretzke et al., 2008). 

Sustained atrophy/degeneration olfactory epithelium under the influence of a cytotoxic agent leads to adaptive tissue remodeling. Cell types unique to olfactory epithelium, e.g. olfactory neurons, sustentacular cells and Bowmans glands, are replaced by cell types comprising respiratory epithelium or squamous epithelium."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/875","Binding of agonist, Ionotropic glutamate receptors","KE 875","The MIE of this AOP can be triggered by direct binding of an agonist to NMDARs or indirectly through initial activation of KA/AMPARs. Indeed, binding of agonist to KA/AMPARs results in ion influx (Na+ and a small efflux of K+) and glutamate release from excitatory synaptic vesicles causing depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron (Dingledine et al. 1999). Upon this depolarization the Mg2+ block is removed from the pore of NMDARs, allowing sodium, potassium, and importantly, calcium ions to enter into a cell. At positive potentials NMDARs then show maximal permeability (i.e., large outward currents can be observed under these circumstances). Due to the time needed for the Mg2+ removal, NMDARs activate more slowly, having a peak conductance long after the KA/AMPAR peak conductance takes place. It is important to note that NMDARs conduct currents only when Mg2+ block is relieved, glutamate is bound, and the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized. For this reason the NMDA receptors act as “coincidence detectors” and play a fundamental role in the establishment of Hebbian synaptic plasticity which is considered the physiological correlate of associative learning (Daoudal and Debanne, 2003; Glanzman, 2005). Post-synaptic membrane depolarization  happens almost always through activation of KA/AMPARs (Luscher and Malenka, 2012). Therefore, a MIE of this AOP is defined as binding of an agonist to these three types of ionotropic receptors (KA/AMPA and NMDA) that can result in a prolonged overactivation of NMDARs through (a) direct binding of an agonist or (b) indirect, mediated through initial KA/AMPARs activation. The excitotoxic neuronal cell death, triggered by sustained NMDARs overactivation in the hippocampus and/or cortex leads to the impaired learning and memory, defined as the adverse outcome (AO) of this AOP.

Biological state: 
L-glutamate (Glu) is a neurotransmitter with important role in the regulation of brain development and maturation processes. Two major classes of Glu receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic, have been identified. Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are integral membrane proteins formed by four large subunits that compose a central ion channel pore. In case of NMDA receptors, two NR1 subunits are combined with either two NR2 (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) subunits and less commonly are assembled together with a combination of NR2 and NR3 (A, B) subunits (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). To be activated NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of both glutamate to NR2 subunits and of glycine to either NR1 or NR3 subunits that provide the specific binding sites named extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Apart from LBDs, NMDA receptor subunits contain three more domains that are considered semiautonomous: 1) the extracellular amino-terminal domain that plays important role in assembly and trafficking of these receptors; 2) the transmembrane domain that is linked with LBD and contributes to the formation of the core of the ion channel and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain that influences membrane targeting, stabilization, degradation and post-translation modifications. 

Biological compartments: 
The genes of the NMDAR subunits are expressed in various tissues and are not only restricted to the nervous system. The level of expression of these receptors in neuronal and non-neuronal cells depends on: transcription, chromatin remodelling, mRNA levels, translation, stabilization of the protein, receptor assembly and trafficking, energy metabolism and numerous environmental stimuli (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). 
In hippocampus region of the brain, NR2A and NR2B are the most abundant NR2 family subunits. NR2A-containing NMDARs are mostly expressed synaptically, while NR2B-containing NMDARs are found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999). 

General role in biology:
NMDA receptors, when compared to the other Glu receptors, are characterized by higher affinity for Glu, slower activation and desensitisation kinetics, higher permeability for calcium (Ca2+) and susceptibility to potential-dependent blockage by magnesium ions (Mg2+). NMDA receptors are involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Functions of NMDA receptors:
1. They are involved in cell signalling events converting environmental stimuli to genetic changes by regulating gene transcription and epigenetic modifications in neuronal cells (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008). 
2. In NMDA receptors, the ion channel is blocked by extracellular Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, allowing the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell which is voltage-dependent. Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptor is considered to play a critical role in pre- and post-synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism important for learning and memory (Barria and Malinow, 2002).
3. The NMDA receptors have been shown to play an essential role in the strengthening of synapses and neuronal differentiation, through long-term potentiation (LTP), and the weakening of synapses, through long-term depression (LTD). All these processes are implicated in the memory and learning function (Barria and Malinow, 2002)."

In mammals, OAT1 and OAT3 have very similar function. These take up small, hydrophilic anions from the plasma of the organism into the cytoplasm of the renal proximal tubule cells.  The multi-drug resistance (MDR) transporters then transport these substrates to the lumen of the proximal convoluted tubules.  Some identified substrates of OAT1 include para-aminohippurate (PAH), dicarboxylates, prostaglandins, cyclic nucleotides, urate, folate, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, antiviral agents, beta-lactam antibiotics, antineoplastics, mycotoxins, sulfate conjugates, glucuronide conjugates, cysteine conjugates, ochratoxin A, NSAIDs, and uremic toxins."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/887","Inhibition, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase  (complex I)","KE 887","Under physiological conditions complex I (CI) couples the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ by reducing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to FMNH2. FMNH2 is then oxidized through a semiquinone intermediate. Each electron moves from the FMNH2 to Fe-S clusters, and from the Fe-S clusters to ubiquinone (Q). Transfer of the first electron results in the formation of the free-radical (semiquinone) form of Q, and transfer of the second electron reduces the semiquinone form to the ubiquinol form (CoQH2). Altogether, four protons are translocated from the mitochondrial matrix to the inter-membrane space for each molecule of NADH oxidized at CI. This leads to the establishment of the electrochemical potential difference (proton-motive force) that may be used to produce ATP (Garrett and Grisham, 2010). Binding of an inhibitor attenuates or completely blocks the activity of CI, i.e. the oxidation of NADH is impaired and protons are not moved. This causes two major consequences: first, electrons are channelled toward oxygen instead Q. This impairs normal oxygen reduction into water at complex IV and leads to the formation of the ROS superoxide at other sites of the respiratory chain. Superoxide may cause damage of proteins, lipid and DNA of the cell, or damage components of the mitochondria after transformation into e.g. hydrogen peroxide. These processes result in mitochondrial dysfunction (Voet and Voet., 2008). The second consequence is the increase of the NADH/NAD+ ratio in mitochondria. This affects the function of key dehydrogenase enzymes in the citric acid cycle and can lead to its block, resulting in an inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial respiration. Prolonged treatment with an inhibitor results in a severe, progressive and irreversible inhibition of complex I, most likely by indirect mechanisms involving oxidative damage (Cleeter et al., 1992). The functional consequences of CI inhibition have been titrated in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Barrientos and Moraes, 1999), with mitochondrial dysfunction measured by a range of different assays (Barrientos and Moraes, 1999; Greenamyre et al., 2001). These included quantification of ROS derived from mitochondria, and of cellular respiration (see KE2: Mitochondrial dysfunction)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/888","Binding of inhibitor, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I)","KE 888","Electron transport through the mitochondrial respiratory chain (oxidative phosphorylation) is mediated by five multimeric complexes (I&ndash;V) that are embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane (Fig. 1). NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase is the Complex I (CI) of electron transport chain (ETC). It is a large assembly of proteins that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane. In mammals, it is composed of about 45-47 protein subunits (human 45) of which 7 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, and ND6) and the remainder by the nuclear genome (Greenamyre, 2001). CI oxidizes NADH elevating the NAD+/NADH ratio by transferring electrons via a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and several iron-sulfur centers to ubiquinone (Friedrich et al., 1994) (Fig. 1). Binding of an inhibitor to CI inhibits the NADH&ndash;ubiquinone oxido-reductase activity, i.e. blocks the electron transfer. Recent studies suggest that a wide variety of CI inhibitors share a common binding domain at or close to the ubiquinone reduction site (Ino et al., 2003). Furthermore, the structural factors required for inhibitory actions have been characterized on the basis of structure-activity relationships (Miyoshi, 1998, Hideto, 1998). Based on molecular docking simulations, in silico models mimicking the binding of chemicals to the pocket of NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase have been created according to the crystal structure of mitochondrial CI. To investigate the ability of chemicals to bind to the active pocket, around 100 individual docking simulations have been performed. These confirmed the possible site of interaction between the chemical and the pocket of CI. In particular, Miao YJ and coworkers recently investigated the IC50 values of 24 chemicals (annonaceous acetogenins) for inhibition of mitochondrial CI (Miao et al., 2014).

Based on their binding sites, CI inhibitors are classified as follows (Degli Esposti, 1998) (Fig. 2): (i) type A inhibitors are antagonists of fully oxidized ubiquinone binding; (ii) type B inhibitors displace the partially reduced ubisemiquinone intermediate; (iii) type C inhibitors are antagonists of the fully reduced ubiquinol product. The affinity of the different types of CI inhibitors to their diverse CI binding sites is described in the paragraph Evidence for Chemical Initiation of this Molecular Initiating Event (see below) in the context of a specific type of inhibitor.

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/889","Impaired, Proteostasis","KE 889","The concept of proteostasis refers to the homeostasis of proteins in space and time, i.e. the correct balance between protein synthesis, modification, transport and degradation. Disturbance of proteostasis results in pathological changes either by loss of function events (lack of a pivotal protein/protein function) or by a gain of undesired functions (aggregation of a protein leading to the formation of inclusions and new structures in cells and disturbing turnover of many unrelated proteins).

Proteostasis regulation is the main defence mechanism against toxic proteins, whose accumulation could greatly compromise normal cellular function and viability. Therefore, the chaperone and degradation systems assuring the removal of misfolded and aggregated proteins, as well as damaged, dysfunctional cellular organelles (e.g. defective mitochondria) play a key role in cellular homeostasis (Lee et al., 2012). The two major degradation systems are the ubiquitin&ndash;proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy&ndash;lysosome pathway (ALP) (Korolchuk et al., 2010; Kroemer et al., 2010; Ravikumar et al., 2010). The UPS works through the attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to a protein substrate, followed by the subsequent degradation of the tagged polyubiquitinated protein by the proteasome (Ciechanover, 1998; Ciechanover and Brundin, 2003). A compromised function of the UPS leads to the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins, such as &alpha;-synuclein (Ii et al. 1997; Spillantini et al. 1997; Sulzer and Zecca 2000). The accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, as a consequence of a dysfunctional proteasome activity, is observed in some pathologies, and experimental inhibition of the proteasome has been shown to trigger parkinsonian neurodegeneration (McNaught and Jenner 2001; Hardy et al., 2001).

ALP involves the engulfment of cytoplasmic materials into autophagosomes, which are degraded by lysosomal enzymes after fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (Kuma et al., 2004) or direct import of proteins into lysosomes (Cuervo, 2004; Mizushima et al., 2008). Autophagy also plays an essential role for the removal of damaged organelles, such as mitochondria. Both, excessive autophagy or reduced autophagic flux can compromise cell survival (Rothermel and Hill, 2007), and several genetic forms of PD are linked to the autophagy-related genes Pink1, Parkin or Uchl1. Autophagy enables cell survival during mitochondrial stress by clearing the damaged organelles (Lee et al., 2012).

One of the main aggregated proteins found to accumulate in nigrostriatal cells during Parkinson&#39;s disease is &alpha;-synuclein. Aggregation of &alpha;-synuclein can obstruct normal cellular transport, leading to impaired intracellular trafficking and/or trapping of cellular organelles in inappropriate locations, this resulting in synaptic and cell dysfunctions (Bartels et al., 2011) (Bellucci A., et al., 2012; Cookson MR., 2005; Games D., et al., 2013; Hunn BH., et al., 2015). Importantly, accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein affects mitochondrial trafficking. The polarity and correct function of different types of cells depend on an efficient transport of mitochondria to areas of high energy consumption (Sheng, 2014). Therefore, the correct distribution of mitochondria to various parts of a cell is essential to preserve cell function (Schwarz, 2013; Zhu et al., 2012)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/890","Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway","KE 890","Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) within the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) i.e. the nigrostriatal pathway, paralleled by the formation of cytoplasmic fibrillar inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB), is regarded as a key event in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) and is, in a quantitative manner, directly linked to the occurrence of clinical signs indicative of PD, i.e impaired motor behavior (Shulman et al., 2011; Jellinger et al., 2009, Dickinson 2012, Dauer et al., 2003). The severity of the clinical signs correlates with the degree of nigral cell loss, and the reduced level of dopamine in the striatum. It is estimated that at the onset of clinical signs, 60% of SNpc neurons are lost, corresponding to an 80% depletion of striatal dopamine (Jellinger et al., 2009). PD is clinically and pathologically defined as a progressive disorder: there is a temporally progress, according to a specific pattern, from the brain stem to the nigrostriatal areas and to cortical locations (Braak et al., 2004 and 2009) and there is a temporal increase in the occurrence of LB, of dopamine depletion in the striatum and of loss of DA neurons in the SNpc (Shulman et al., 2012). Indeed, in patients with PD there is a more evident loss of dopamine in striatum compared to SNpc, indicating that striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals are the primary target of the degenerative process in the nigrostriatal pathway and that neuronal loss in SNpc would result as a final outcome (Hornykiewicz et al., 1966; Dauer et al., 2003; Bernhaimer et al., 1973; Pavese et al., 2009). Studies in PD patients and experimental models are also suggesting that progression from striatal terminal to loss of DA neurons occurs through a &ldquo;dying back&rdquo; axonopathy pathology and that axonal dysfuction may be an important hallmark in PD (Orimo et al., 2005; Raff et al., 2002; Kim-Han et al., 2011; O&rsquo;Malley 2010).

In human brain, the classical Lewy body (LB) is characterized at light microscopy by eosinophilic, spherical, intra-cytoplasmatic inclusion and it stains for &alpha;-synuclein and ubiqutin proteins which form the ultrastructural fibrillar core of LB visible at transmission electron microscopy. On autopsy, from individuals affected by PD, accumulation of aggregates positive for &alpha;-synuclein protein are also observed within neuronal processes, called Lewy neurites (LN), as well as by neurons showing a more diffuse or granular peri-nuclear pattern (Dickson 2012). Because dopaminergic cells are rich in melanin, their loss is detectable by depigmentation of the midbrain at gross pathology examination (Dickson 2012; Shulman et al., 2010). However, it should be noted that, although LB are recognized as characteristic of PD, they are not found in a minority of clinically defined PD cases (Dauer 2003) and they can also be observed in other diseases (Dickson 2012).

The biological function of the nigrostriatal pathway depends on the intactness of its anatomical structure. Preservation of the striatum terminals and of neuronal cell bodies of DA neurons in the SNpc is a prerequisite for the maintenance of the physiological function (Fujita et al., 2014). The nigrostriatal system is anatomically located in the basal ganglia loop which comprises the motor system structures caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidum and subsatantia nigra. The caudate nucleus and the putamen are collectively called striatum (David Robinson in: Neurobiology, Springer edition, 1997). The system plays a unique integrative role in the control of movement as part of a system called the &ldquo;basal ganglia motor loop&rdquo;. This anatomical loop includes structures in the thalamus, motor and somatosensory cortex and wide regions of surrounding cortex. Neurons of the SN produce dopamine ( DA) and project to the striatum. They give dopaminergic excitatory (D1 receptors) and inhibitory (D2 receptors) inputs to striatal interneurons (GABAergic). These control thalamic output to the motor cortex. Degeneration within the SNpc leads to a decreased thalamic activation of the motor cortex. (Shulman et al., 2011).

The dopaminergic cells localized in the SNpc synthesize the transmitter substance dopamine (DA) and make extensive contacts within the caudate and putamen (the striatum). These DA neurons have a complex morphology and high energy demand. They are provided with very long and dense arborisations projecting into the striatum where DA is released. This unique morphological characteristics demand a high level of energy to maintain the activity at the synaptic level, to compensate for the risk of depolarization of the poorly myelinated fibres and to support a long distance axonal transport. This puts a tremendous burden on mitochondrial functions (Pissadaki et al., 2013). SNpc neurons are provided with specific calcium channels, the L-type Cav 1.3 which are intended to regulate the autonomous firing as &ldquo;pacemaker&rdquo;. The high demand of calcium buffering arising from this is handled by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and by the mitochondria. This is a function specific for SNpc DA neurons, as the dopaminergic neurons belonging to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are using Na+ channels as a pacemaker. Additional peculiarities of the neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway are the high number of synapses and the higher probability of these neurons to accumulate misfolded proteins, including &alpha;-synuclein. Furthermore, the nigrostriatal pathway metabolism of DA is known to induce oxidative and nitrative stress (Fujita et al., 2014; Asanuma et al., 2003; Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2003; Pissadaki et al., 2013) making DA neurons particularly sensitive to oxidative stress (Lotharius and Brundin, 2002). DA neurons in SNpc also have a relatively low mitochondria mass which may contribute to the vulnerability of these neurons (Liang et al., 2007). In addition, increased levels of iron have been observed in SN of PD patients (Gotz et al., 2004) and the high content of iron in dopamine neurons has been reported to trigger oxidative/nitrosative stress and subsequent neurodegeneration (Ayton and Lei 2014; Benshachar et al., 1991). As a consequence, these neurons are particularly sensitive to various stressors that can contribute to their vulnerability and preferential loss (Fujita et al., 2014)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/896","Parkinsonian motor deficits","KE 896","A large number of neurological disorders are characterized by a clinical syndrome with motor symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity and postural instability. As these clinical features are common to multiple disorders, the clinical syndrome is referred as &ldquo;parkinsonism&rdquo; and when parkinsonism is representing the prevalent part of the syndrome, these are referred as &ldquo;parkinsonian disorders&rdquo;. Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD) is one of parkinsonian disorders and can have an idiopathic, genetic or toxic (i.e. MPTP induced parkinsonism) cause (Dickson 2012). All these disorders include a deregulation of the extrapyramidal system.

The pyramidal motor system comprises bundles of neurons originating in the motor centers of the cerebral cortex to terminate in the brainstem or in the spinal cord where they are responsible for voluntary control of motor functions (Brooks 1971). The extrapyramidal system, which is the anatomical organization of the AO, is the part of the motor system primarily involved in the control and regulation of involuntary motor control, and in fine tuning (Barnes et al., 1983). Especially the initiation and maintenance of complex movement patterns or of neuronal regulatory pathways involved in postural control of the body are regulated by the nigrostriatal system that is affected in parkinsonian states. The CNS input is modulated by extrapyramidal circuits before the execution of complex motor movements. The modulated information from the basal ganglia is looped back through the thalamus to the cortex, from where final motor signals are sent via the pyramidal system; i.e. the basal ganglia system is not involved in the control of motor neurons and striatal muscles, but it modulates the signals from the cortex to these systems. Thus, an impaired input of dopamine into the striatum leads to an impairment of this modulation loop, and a disturbance of basal ganglia feedback to the thalamus and cortex. This ultimately manifests in key parkinsonian symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia (Bernheimer et al., 1973). These conditions can be generated experimentally by dopamine depletion with reserpine, by inhibition of dopamine receptors, by mechanical or chemical ablation of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons (cut of the median forebrain bundle or injection of the toxicant 6-OH-dopamine) or the application of toxicants that leading to a relatively selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (e.g. MPTP) and therefore a reduction of dopamine in the striatum (Kolata et al., 1983).

The basal ganglia include the ventral striatum, the neostriatum composed of the putamen and the caudate nucleus, the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe), the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (Obeso et al., 2008). The main input sites into basal ganglia are the striatum and the STN where cortical (glutamatergic) innervations terminate in a topographically organized manner that largely reflects the organization in the cortex (Fallon et al., 1978; Takada et al., 1998). Both the GPi and the SNpr represent the main output nuclei projecting into the thalamus (Parent et al., 1999; Alexander et al., 1990). The connection between input and output nuclei is functionally organized into a &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and an &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; pathway (Silverdale et al., 2003). These two pathways in parallel regulate the activity of the basal ganglia output neurons of the GPi and STN and are modulated by dopamine in the striatum. The dopaminergic terminals in teh striatum originate from dopaminergic projections from the SNpc. Striatal dopamine modulates the activity of inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons that make up 90% of all neurons in the striatum (Smith et al., 1994). Medium spiny neurons that preferentially express the D1 dopamine receptor are involved in the direct pathway and directly project into the two main output nuclei (GPi and SNpr). Activation of the D1 medium spiny neuronal direct pathway results in a reduction of the inhibitory basal ganglia output (GPi and SNpr) leading to a dis-inhibition of thalamic target neurons (Bolam et al., 2000). These events ultimately lead to an elevated activity in the respective cortical neurons, i.e. D1 signalling in the striatum leads to an increase in motor activity.

Medium spiny neurons predominantly expressing the D2 dopamine receptor mostly project to the GPe (Gerfen et al., 1990). Activation of D2 expressing neurons leads to an inhibition of their activity. D2 neurons of the indirect pathway connect the striatum with GPi/SNpr via synaptic connections in the GPe and the STN. Activating neurons originating in the STN project into the GPi/SNpr are glutamatergic. From the STN, activating glutamatergic neuronal projections into the GPi/SNpr lead to a basal, low activation. Activation of the indirect pathway by striatal dopamine from the substantia nigra hence leads to a low basal inhibitory GABAergic output into thalamic structures, and thus allows a strong motor cortex activation of the thalamus.



Functional anatomy of basal ganglia. A) Normal conditions. Striatal (STR) dopamine mainly originates from projections originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The STR is mainly composed of inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN). MSN involved in the direct pathway directly project to the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) and the sunstantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) leading to a basal inhibition of these output nuclei. MSN involved in the indirect pathway send inhibitory projections to the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe). Their activity is dampened by dopamine binding to D2 receptor expressing MSN in the striatum. B) Lack of striatal dopamine. Under conditions of a lack of striatal dopamine, inhibitory GABAergic neurons, originating in the striatum, receive less activation, resulting in a declined inhibition of GPi and SNpr inhibitory output. In the indirect pathway, the lack of dopamine causes a lack of its inhibitory influence on inhibitory GABAergic projections into the GPe. This accelerated inhibition of the GPe results in a decline in its inhibitory output into the STN. The decline in STN inhibition allows its overactivation, resulting in an excessive activation of stimulatory glutamatergic projections into the GPi and SNpr (according to Silverdale 2003).

Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease is characterized by a decline in striatal dopamine input from the substantia nigra pars compacta (Smith t al., 1994). Under normal conditions, ganglial output via GPi/SNpr nuclei causes a moderate inhibitory influence on cortical and brainstem motor neurons. A reduction in striatal dopamine leads to an underactivation of D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway. This insufficient activation of the inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons results in a reduction of its normal inhibitory influence on GPi and SNpr output nuclei. As a consequence, dopamine depletion leads to the overactivation of the inhibitory GABAergic GPi/SNpr output via the direct pathway (Mitchell et al., 1989).

In the indirect pathway, the reduced activation of D2 receptors expressing neurons leads to an overactivation of inhibitory output nuclei projecting into the GPe. The resulting inhibitory output of the GPe is hence reduced, thus leading to a declined inhibition of the STN. Overactivation of the stimulatory glutamatergic projections originating in the STN leads to the hyperactivation of the output GPi/SNpr nuclei. As a consequence of striatal dopamine depletion, the direct pathway becomes underactivated and the indirect pathway becomes overactivated. This leads to an overactivation of the basal ganglia output nuclei. Due to their inhibitory influence on thalamocortical motor centers, the resulting reduced cortical activation leads to the prominent impairment of motor functions in parkinsonian states (Silverdale et al., 2003).

The model of direct and indirect pathways linking striatal dopamine content with the basal ganglia output nuclei has been criticized in recent years as it ignores the influence of extrastriatal dopamine (Smith et al., 2000), or the fact that some medium spiny neurons express dopamine receptors of both the D1 and of the D2 type (Surmeier et al., 1996). Principal validity of the model and the central role of striatal dopamine was e.g. demonstrated by L-DOPA-mediated supplementation of striatal dopamine content in unprimed PD patients that causes a partial reduction in the overactivation of GPi/SNpr output (Yuan et al., 2010; Heimer et al., 2006). As an alternative way for symptomatic treatment of parkinsonian conditions, deep brain stimulation of either the STN or the GPi was shown to relieve from parkinsonian motor features (Mazzone 2003, Odekerken 2013)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/898","Disruption, Lysosome","KE 898","Lysosomes were first described in 1955 (de Duve et al., 1955). They are acidic, single-membrane bound organelles that are present in all eukaryotic cells and are filled with more than 50 acid hydrolases to serve their purpose of degrading macromolecules (Johansson et al., 2010).

Lysosomes are the terminal organelle of the endocytic pathway, but are also involved in membrane repair and other cellular processes, such as immune responses (Repnik and Turk, 2010). There are numerous substances that can provoke increased permeability of lysosomal membrane or total lysosomal rupture, and as a consequence release of lysosomal enzymes. Among lysosomal enzymes, one of the major roles has cathepins. There are 11 cysteine cathepins in humans, B, C, F, H, K, L, O, S, V, W and X. Activation of proenzymes usually occurs within the lysosomes (Ishidoh and Kominami, 2002), therefore, the enzymes escaping from the lysosomes are in their active form. The amount of lysosomal enzymes that are released into the cytosol regulates the cell death pathway which is initiated by lysosomal damage: controlled increased permeability of lysosomal membrane, caused by limited level of stress, plays a vital role in the induction of apoptosis, whereas massive lysosomal rupture, caused by high stress levels, leads to necrosis (Bursch, 2001; Guicciardi et al., 2004). Lysosomes are known to be involved in external as well as internal apoptotic pathways. The external pathway triggers lysosomal destabilization by hydroxyl radicals, p53, and caspase 8, through activation of Bax or by ceramide which is converted into sphingosine (Terman et al., 2004). The internal apoptotic pathway on the contrary is activated through mitochondrial damage, for example via activation of Bax or Bid, phospholipases, or lysosomal enzymes (Terman et al., 2004). It has been shown that lack of cathepsin B prevents increased lysosomal membrane permeability in hepatocytes treated with TNF or sphingosine (Werneburg et al., 2002). This indicates that cathepsins can also have a role in initiation of increased lysosomal membrane permeabilization.

The lysosome contains redox-active labile irons which are suggested to be involved in local ROS production via a Fenton-type reaction (Kubota et al., 2010). It has been shown that lysosomal membrane disruption induced by lysosomotropic detergents causes early induction of lysosomal cathepsin B and D and induction of ferritin, together with an increase of cellular ROS and concomitant reduction of the antioxidants MnSOD (manganese superoxide dismutase) and GSH (glutathione), possibly due to the release of free iron into the cytosol (Ghosh et al., 2011; Hamacher-Brady et al., 2011).

The list of agents able to destabilize lysosomal membrane includes L-Leucyl-L-leucinemethyl ester (LLOMe) (Goldman and Kaplan, 1973; Uchimoto et al. 1999; Droga-Mazovec et al., 2008),  N-dodecylimidazole (NDI) (Wilson et al., 1987), sphingosine (Kagedal et al., 2001), detergent MSDH (Li et al., 2000), siramesine (Ostenfeld et al., 2005), the quinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin (Boya et al., 2003a),  hydroxychloroquine (Boya et al., 2003b) and NPs (Wang et al., 2018).

Cirman et al. showed that the lysosomotropic agent LLOMe inducing the disruption of lysosomes results in translocation of lysosomal proteases to the cytosol and induce apoptosis through a caspase dependent mechanism (Cirman et al., 2004). However, it has been proven that partially increased permeabilization of lysosome leads to apoptosis, while complete breakdown of the lysosome with release of high concentrations of the enzymes into the cytosol results in necrosis (Bursch, 2001; Kurz et al., 2008).

The short-term exposure to low concentrations of H2O2 induce lysosomal rupture by activation of phospholipase A2, which cause a progressive destabilization of the membranes of intracellular organelles degrading the membrane phospholipids (Zhao et al., 2001). Sumoza-Toledo and Penner showed that ROS activate lysosomal Ca2+ channels and contribute to increased lysosomal permeability (Sumoza-Toledo and Penner, 2011).  

Considering nanomaterials (NMs) as a trigger for lysosomal damage, recent studies underpinned the importance of lysosomal NM uptake for NM-induced toxicity. Once the material is taken up by a cell and transported to the lysosome by autophagy, the acidic milieu herein can either enhance solubility of a NM, or the material remains in its initial nano form. Both situations can induce toxicity, causing lysosomal swelling, followed by lysosomal disruption and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins (Wang et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2012). Wang et al. showed that the exposure of cells to NH2-PS NPs results in increased lysosomal membrane permeability and release of lysosomal proteasis (cathepsin B and cathepsin D) into cytosol (Wang et al., 2018)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/927","KE1 : S-Glutathionylation, eNOS","KE 927","S-glutathionylation is a redox-dependent, reversible post-translational modification that is involved in the regulation of various regulatory, structural, and metabolic proteins (Pastore and Piemonte, 2013). Under oxidative stress, S-glutathionylation targets cysteine residues of a protein and adds glutathione through thiol-disulfide exchange with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) or reaction of oxidant-induced protein thiyl radicals with reduced glutathione (Chen et al., 2010, 2011, Schuppe et al. 1992). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulates vascular function by generating nitric oxide which is involved in endothelium-dependent relaxation, and control of blood pressure and vascular tone. It has been shown that cysteine residues are important for the maintenance of normal eNOS function. Under oxidative stress, S-glutathionylation of eNOS was induced by GSSG at residue sites Cys 689 and Cys 908, resulting in a decrease in eNOS activity and an increase in superoxide generation, also known as eNOS uncoupling. Furthermore, eNOS S-glutathionylation was shown to be abundant in the vessel walls of spontaneously hypertension rats (SHRs), in contrast to non-hypertensive rats.   SHRs demonstrated impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which was reversible upon administration of the reducing agent, dithiothreitol (Chen et al. 2010).  Similarly in human aortic endothial cells, exposure to ultrafine particles caused a decrease in NO production in a dose-depedent manner.  This was shown to be prevented upon over-expression of glutaredoxin-1, which inhibits eNOS S-glutathionylation (Du et al. 2013)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/932","KE4 : Uncoupling, eNOS","KE 932","Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is responsible for the generation of vascular nitric oxide (NO), a protective molecule that is involved in the regulation of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, vascular tone, and blood pressure (F&ouml;rstermann and M&uuml;nzel, 2006). To generate NO, eNOS hydroxylates L-arginine to N-hydroxy-L-arginine and then oxidizes N-hydroxy-L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO. This enzymatic process requires NADPH, Ca2+/calmondulin, flavin mononucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide and its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Limiting BH4 levels or S-glutathionylation of eNOS can lead to eNOS uncoupling in which eNOS produces superoxide (or other reactive oxygen species) and less NO. The uncoupling of eNOS has been demonstrated to cause endothelial dysfunction, and is implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus (Dumitrescu et al., 2007)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/933","KE6 : Depletion, Nitric Oxide","KE 933","Nitric oxide (NO), constitutively produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), is an important regulator of vascular homeostasis. Endothelial-derived NO promotes vasodilation and protects against atherogenesis through the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, platelet aggregation and adhesion, and leukocyte adherence. Its effects have an influence on vascular resistance, blood pressure, vascular remodeling and angiogenesis (Luo et al., 2000). Dysfunctional eNOS as a result of eNOS uncoupling leads to a decrease or loss of NO bioavailability and an elevation of superoxide production (Crabtree et al., 2009). The imbalance of NO and superoxide is associated with many disorders, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/934","KE3 : Decrease, Tetrahydrobiopterin","KE 934","Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for a group of enzymes including aromatic acid hydroxylases, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, and alkylglycerol monooxygenase (Wang et al., 2014). BH4 is synthesized from guanosine triphosphate through sequential reactions catalyzed by enzymes GTPCH-1, pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase, and sepiapterin reductase (Tatham et al., 2009). During NOS catalysis, BH4 donates electrons to the ferrous-dioxygen complex in the oxygenase domain, leading to oxidation of L-arginine to N-hydroxy-Larginine and eventually conversion to citrulline and nitric oxide production (Chen et al., 2011; Crabtree et al., 2009). BH4 also stabilizes dimers of NOS isoforms, which is required for their enzymatic activity. When BH4 levels are decreased or limited, for example under oxidative stress conditions, BH4 can be oxidized to dihydrobiopterin (BH2) and then converted to biopterin. This reduction in BH4 availability results in NOS uncoupling where NOS is uncoupled from L-arginine oxidation and superoxide (or other reactive species) is produced rather than nitric oxide (Carnicer et al., 2012). Decreased BH4 have been demonstrated in a variety of vascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis where endothelial dysfunction occurs."

GTPCH-1 catalyzes the rearrangement of GTP to 7-dihydroneopterin triphosphate, which is converted to BH4 through sequential actions of pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. GTPCH-1 activity is regulated in a negative feedback by levels of BH4 which promotes binding of GTPCH-1 with its inhibitor GTPCH feedback regulatory protein (GFRP), but phosphorylation of GTPCH-1 reduces its binding to GFRP and prevents this negative feedback (Chen et al., 2011).  Loss or inactivation of GTPCH-1 results in decreased BH4 levels, which causes eNOS uncoupling."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/941","Activation, EGFR","KE 941","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also referred to as ERBB1/HER1) is part of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases comprising another three distinct receptors, ERBB2/NEU/HER2, ERBB3/HER3 and ERBB4/HER4 (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001), all of which are transmembrane glycoproteins with an extracellular ligand binding site and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Receptor-ligand binding induces dimerization and internalization, subsequently leading to activation of the receptor through autophosphorylation (Higashiyama et al., 2008). 

ERBB family of receptors are expressed in tissues of epithelial, mesenchymal and neuronal origin, and EGFR pathway is involved in wide range of processes such as reproduction, growth and development (Wong, 2003, Yano et al., 2003). EGFR signaling is central to airway epithelial maintenance and mucin production (Burgel and Nadel, 2008), and EGFR expression has been demonstrated in lung epithelial cells under physiological (albeit weakly) as well as pathological conditions in vitro and in vivo (Aida et al., 1994, Burgel and Nadel, 2008, Polosa et al., 1999, O&rsquo;donnell et al., 2004). Of note, lung epithelial cell EGFR phosphorylation (i.e., activation) was increased under conditions of oxidative stress including exposure to H2O2 (Goldkorn et al., 1998), naphthalene (Van Winkle et al., 1997), cigarette smoke (Marinaş et al., 2011) and in the presence of neutrophils or neutrophil elastase (Kohri et al., 2002, Shao and Nadel, 2005, Shim et al., 2001, Takeyama et al., 2000). EGFR activation by oxidative stress may have a number of root causes: ROS were shown to increase production of EGF, the prime EGFR ligand, by lung epithelial cells (Casalino-Matsuda et al., 2004). Similarly, expression and secretion of TGF-&alpha; and AREG, also EGFR ligands, were elevated in human bronchial epithelial cells in response to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cigarette smoke exposure (Blanchet et al., 2004, Lemjabbar et al., 2003, Rumelhard et al., 2007). Mechanistically, this process is dependent on activation of metalloproteinases or ADAMs which cleave membrane-bound EGFR ligand precursors, making them locally available to bind to and transactivate EGFR in an autocrine manner (Deshmukh et al., 2005, Val et al., 2012, Yoshisue and Hasegawa, 2004). Furthermore, ligand binding to EGFR itself was shown to lead to H2O2 production, thereby facilitating receptor activation and downstream signaling, partly also through inhibition of EGFR phosphatase PTP1B (DeYulia et al., 2005, DeYulia Jr. and C&aacute;rcamo, 2005, Truong and Carroll, 2012). In addition, multiple lines of evidence suggest that oxidative modification, specifically EGFR sulfenylation, contributes to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and downstream signaling (Paulsen et al., 2011, Truong and Carroll, 2012, Truong et al., 2016). 

Classical EGFR downstream signaling involves activation of RAS which subsequently initiates signal transduction through the RAF1/MEK/ERK cascade (Hackel et al., 1999). The activation of this pathway promotes airway epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and facilitates epithelial wound repair (Chambard et al., 2007, Berlanga-Acosta et al., 2009). Another principal signaling cascade downstream of EGFR is phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, which promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis (Goffin and Zbuk, 2013). 

Evidence for Perturbation by Stressor 

EGFR activation in respiratory tract epithelial cells can be triggered by exposure to hydrogen peroxide (Goldkorn et al., 1998, Takeyama et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2010b), ozone (Wu et al., 2015, McCullough et al., 2014, Feng et al., 2016), naphthalene (Van Winkle et al., 1997), cigarette smoke (Takeyama et al., 2001, Yu et al., 2012a), nicotine (Wang et al., 2020b, Mart&iacute;nez-Garc&iacute;a et al., 2008), benzo[a]pyrene and its diol epoxide metabolite (Kometani et al., 2009, Xu et al., 2012), acrolein (Deshmukh et al., 2008), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) (Jin et al., 2017, Jeong et al., 2017, Huang et al., 2017, Jiao et al., 2022, Tung et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2020a), carbon nanoparticles (St&ouml;ckmann et al., 2018), (Shang et al., 2020), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Takezawa et al., 2016), 2,3-butanedione (Kelly et al., 2019), and other chemical stressors such as hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol A (Koike et al., 2016), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (Lee et al., 2011). Some of these stressors induce EGFR pathway activation also in other cell models. In addition to respiratory epithelium, acrolein activated EGFR in human normal oral keratinocytes (Takeuchi et al., 2001, Tsou et al., 2021) as well as in mouse J774A.1 macrophage cell line (Kim et al., 2010a), PM 2.5 induced EGFR activation in human thyroid follicular epithelial Nthy-ori 3-1 cells (Moscatello et al., 2022). Following nicotine treatment EGFR was shown to be activated in MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Nishioka et al., 2011) and in human dysplastic oral keratinocytes (Wisniewski et al., 2018). LPS activates EGFR in several different model systems such as intestinal epithelial cells, RAW 264.7 macrophages, mammary epithelial cells, human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBECs), etc (McElroy et al., 2012, Lu et al., 2014, De et al., 2015, Liu et al., 2013). Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. SDF-1&alpha;) induce EGFR activity in IMR90 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Shang et al., 2020)."

	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a member of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) family of proteins (Gu et al 2000).
	PAS proteins share highly conserved PAS domains (Gu et al 2000).
	PAS proteins act as transcriptional regulators in response to environmental and physiological cues (Gu et al 2000).
	ARNTs have numerous key roles in vertebrates related to responses to developmental and environmental cues.


Isoforms of ARNT:


	Over time ARNT has undergone gene duplication and diversification in vertebrates, which has resulted in three clades of ARNT, namely ARNT1, ARNT2, and ARNT3.
	Each clade can include multiple isoforms and splice variants (Hill et al 2009; Lee et al 2007; Lee et al 2011; Powel &amp; Hahn 2000; Tanguay et al 2000).
	ARNT1s have been demonstrated to function predominantly through heterodimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 &alpha; (HIF1&alpha;) (Prasch et al 2004; 2006; Wang et al 1995).
	ARNT2s are believed to function predominantly through heterodimerization with Single Minded (SIM) (Hirose et al 1996).
	ARNT3s, which are also known as ARNT-like (ARNTL), Brain and Muscle ARNT-like-1 (BMAL1), or Morphine Preference 3 (MOP3), are believed to function predominantly through heterodimerization with Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) (Gekakis et al 1998).


Roles of ARNTs in mammals:


	ARNT1 functions in normal vascular and hematopoietic development (Kozak et al 1997; Maltepe et al 1997; Abbott &amp; Buckalew 2000).
	ARNT2 functions in development of the hypothalamus and nervous system (Hosoya et al 2001; Keith et al 2001).
	ARNT3 functions in biological rhythms (Gekakis et al 1998).


Roles of ARNTs in other taxa:


	ARNTs have been demonstrated to have roles in development of the heart, brain, liver, and possibly the peripheral nervous system in zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Hill et al 2009).
	Roles of ARNTs in other taxa have not been sufficiently investigated to date.


Interaction with AHR


	Both ARNT1s and ARNT2s are able to heterodimerize with AhR and interact with dioxin-responsive elements on the DNA in in vitro systems (Hirose et al 1996; Lee et al 2007; Lee et al 2011; Prasch et al 2004).
	Selective knockdown of ARNTs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) demonstrates that ARNT1s, but not ARNT2s, are required for activation of the AhR in vivo (Prasch et al 2004; 2006).
	In limited investigations ARNT3 has not been demonstrated to interact with the AHR either in vivo or in vitro (Jain et al 1998). 


Upon ligand binding, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) migrates to the nucleus where it dissociates from the cytosolic complex and forms a heterodimer with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) (Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama 2003). The AHR-ARNT complex then binds to a xenobiotic response element (XRE) found in the promoter of an AHR-regulated gene and recruits co-regulators such as CREB binding protein/p300, steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) 1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and nuclear receptor interacting protein 1, leading to induction or repression of gene expression (Fujii-Kuriyama and Kawajiri 2010). Expression levels of several genes, including phase I (e.g. cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, CYP1B, CYP2A) and phase II enzymes (e.g. uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)), as well as genes involved in cell proliferation (transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1 beta), cell cycle regulation (p27, jun-B) and apoptosis (Bax), are regulated through this mechanism (Fujii-Kuriyama and Kawajiri 2010; Giesy et al. 2006; Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama 2003; Safe 1994)."

It is defined as a chronic elevation in blood pressure and is characterized by elevated systemic vascular resistance due to dysregulated vasomotor function and structural remodeling (Lee and Griendling, 2008). Although many genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development to hypertension, oxidative stress appears to be the main pathway involved in its pathogenesis. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling, resulting in increased superoxide production but decreased nitric oxide (NO), a critical regulator of vascular homeostasis (Silva et al., 2012). Depletion of NO leads to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, thus promoting endothelial dysfunction, which is a hallmark of hypertension."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/957","Binding, Transthyretin in serum","KE 957","The key event that initiates this AOP (i.e. the MIE) is binding of a xenobiotic to the thyroxine (T4)-binding site of transthyretin (TTR), displacing T4 from the binding site(s) of TTR and adding this to the pool of free T4 in serum, which is normally roughly 0.02% (20 pM) of total T4 (100 nM) [in CSF, free T4 is roughly 1.4% (70 pM) of total T4 (2-3 nM)](Schweizer and Kohrle 2013).

TTR has been found to bind with a number of ligands, including pharmacologic agents as well as flavonoids and halogenated aromatic compounds, with differing strengths with some xenobiotics found to be possessing a binding affinity equal to or stronger than T4 (i.e. &quot;competitive binder&quot;).  Studies with other xenobiotics with similar structural characteristics have found that a higher degree of halogen substitution, as well as placement on the ring relative to the hydroxyl group, increases binding affinity (Chauhan et al. 2000, Lans et al. 1993, Lans et al. 1994, Ren and Guo 2012, van den Berg 1990, van den Berg et al. 1991, Weiss et al 2015). Weiss et al (2015) compiled a database of almost 150 compounds found to bind to TTR and 52 of these were found to have higher affinity than T4 and thus, could be considered competitive binders in serum.

The function of the serum protein TTR is to deliver T4 to target cells in the liver, tight junctions, etc. where it is facilitated across the membrane via specific receptors and converted to the active form T3, where it can activate nuclear receptors. TTR facilitates passage across key tight junctions, such as the blood-brain barrier, the CSF barrier and transplacentally, and the interruption of thyroid serum protein-assisted transport during certain developmental windows can lead to profound developmental neurotoxicity (i.e. cretinism).  It should be noted, though, that in mammals with all three functional serum transport proteins (TTR, albumin and TBG), substantial reductions in total T4 can be observed with little to no adverse effect due to overall redundancy of this system. In this scenario, roughly 75% of serum T4 is bound to TBG, 15% to TTR and up to 5% for to albumin (OECD DRP 2012).  That being said, TTR is the sole transport protein in the CSF and T4 is not biosynthesized by the fetus until the second trimester - thus, the mother is the sole source of T4 for the fetus during early gestation and this appears to be the developmental window of greatest concern to human physiology (for example, see Loubiere et al 2010)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/958","Displacement, Serum thyroxine (T4) from transthyretin","KE 958","Despite the two binding sites for T4 on the TTR serum binding protein, each molecule of TTR only carries a single T4 molecule due to the negative cooperativity displayed by these binding sites (Ferguson et al 1975). As such, xenobiotics and pharmacologic agents can displace T4 from TTR and early on, this was demonstrated for ethnacrynic acid, salicylates, penicillin and 2,4-dinitrophenol (Munro et al 1989). More recently, work with the flavonoid EMD 21388 (and other compounds structurally similar to thyroxine) showed competitive binding and displacement of T4 from the TTR carrier protein.

Rickenbacher et al (1986) provided initial direct evidence of competition for the T4 binding site using molecular modeling and binding assays using radiolabeled TH. Brouwer and van den Berg (1986) reported preferential binding of a metabolite of radiolabeled tetrachlorobiphenyl to TTR in rats (15 mg/kg, ip), using gel electrophoresis followed by HPLC analysis. Van den Berg (1990) used a competitive binding assay to assess the ability of hydroxylated chlorinated aromatic compounds to bind to radiolabeled T4. Van den Berg et al (1991) extended this work to 65 compounds from 12 different chemical groups in rats treated via a single ip dose and competitive binding assay. Chlorophenols were found to have higher affinity relative to other chlorinated aromatics, particular at higher levels of chlorination, and the combination of hydroxyl chlorine atoms in the ortho position. {insert Figure 2/Van den Berg 1990}

Kohrle et al (1989) showed complete displacement (via gel electrophoresis) of radiolabeled T3 and T4 by EMD 21388 in pooled rat serum followed by increase in the percent free TH as measured by equilibrium dialysis. Complete inhibition occurred at 10 umol and displaced T4 from TTR to serum albumin and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which normally serve a lesser role in thyroid hormone transport in humans. {insert Figure 2}

Kohrle et al (1989) administered EMD 21388 via ip route to rats at 2 umol/100 g BW and observed displacement of radiolabeled T3 and T4 from TTR followed by a decrease of T3 and T4 in serum while the percent free TH remained unchanged. {insert Figures 3-5}

Lueprasitsakul et al (1990) repeated this protocol and found that inhibition of binding occurred within 3 minutes followed by a decrease in serum T4 concentration and an increase in both serum percent free T4 as well serum total T4. {insert Figures 1 and 4}

Mendel et al (1992) demonstrated in rats dosed via IP with EMD 21388 (2 &mu;mol/100 g BW) both displacement of radiolabeled T4 from TTR (as assessed via electrophoresis of serum proteins) and susbsequent increase of free T4 in serum.

To initially evaluate the impact of EMD 21388 on maternal/fetal hormones, Pedraza et al (1996) administered 2.5 mg 21388/day subcutaneously in pregnant female rats which led to displacement of T4 from TTR, reduced total T4 and increased free T4 in maternal circulation.

 

Compounds that have been found to compete with TTR for binding to T4 (and thus lead to some degree of thyroid disruption) include pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants, such as halogenated aromatic compounds.  This latter category include PCBs, PBBs, PBDEs and perfluoro compounds and specifically, hydroxylated metabolites of all these compounds often display greater binding affinity than the natural ligand; however, this is a function of degree of halogenation as well as orientation of the halogens and hydroxyl functional group.

Gutshall et al 1989 treated male Wistar rats with a single IP dose of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and 125I and then measured TH, uptake of 125I, liver enzymes and binding of [125I]-T4 to albumin.  The authors did not observe increased conversion of T4 to rT3 but did note that PFDA displaced [125I]-T4 from rat albumin with an affinity similar to T4.  While this study involved albumin, it showed that perfluoro compounds may also have potential to interact with thyroid serum transport proteins.

Meerts et al 2000 investigated the affinity of several polybrominated flame retardants (including 17 PBDE congeners) to TTR using human TTR in an in vitro competitive binding assay and [125I]-T4. Pentabromophenol and tetrabromobisphenol A were found to have affinities 7-10 fold that of T4; however, a microsomal enzyme mediated transformation was needed first (i.e. hydroxylation) for PBDEs.  It should be noted that no reference OH-PBDEs were available at the time of this experiment.  Like the PCB congeners, degree of bromination is a driver of binding potency as is the nature of the halogen substitution (as well as hydroxy substitution).  In addition, brominated analogs are more potent in general relative to chlorinated ones.  Hydroxylation of parent compound via CYP2B enzymes appears to be a prerequisite of binding to TTR.

Hallgren et al 2001 treated female Sprague Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice daily with Aroclor 1254, PCB-105, Bromkal 70-5 DE (commercial PBDE mixture) or BDE-47 via gavage for 14 days and measured TH, induction of microsomal phase I enzymes (EROD, MROD, PROD) and UDP UGT activity.  Free and total T4 was decreased in both species with no significant change to TSH and minimal impact on UDP UGT activity.  Rats were found to be more sensitive than mice to the observed effects.  The findings suggested that PBDEs may be metabolized by CYP2B, but also CYP1A to an extent, and that these induced enzymes increased the availability of hydroxylated metabolites in vivo and increase binding to T4 transport proteins. 

Hallgren and Darnerud 2002 treated female Sprague Dawley rats with BDE-47, Aroclor 1254 and Witaclor 171P, alone or in combinations, daily via gastric intubation for 14 days. Microsomal enzyme (cytochrome P450 isozymes and UDP UGTs), ex vivo binding of [125I]-T4 to plasma proteins and light microscopy morphology of the thyroid was examined. Aroclor 1254 and BDE-47 was observed to decrease T4, decrease [125I]-T4 binding to TTR, induce several phase I enzymes as well as moderate elevation of UDP UGT activity.  These data suggested that decreased plasma T4 is mainly due to interference with serum transport binding of parent and metabolites to TTR; however, there was clearly some role for glucuronidation in reducing T4 in this study. (PCB mixtures have been demonstrated to impact a number of different endpoints affecting normal thyroid homeostasis.)

Metabolites of BDE 47 formed by CYP2B6 include hydroxylated BDE 47 in addition to other hydroxylated congeners (Erratico et al 2013, Feo et al 2013) and it should be noted that CYP2B6 is also expressed in brain which has implications for formation of hydroxylates in that tissue (Miksys and Tyndale 2004).

Cao et al 2004 performed molecular docking analysis on the TTR and OH-PBDE interactions and confirmed the effect of degree of bromination.

Darnerud et al 2006 treated female Sprague Dawley rats with BDE 47 or Bromkal 70-5 DE at 2 doses via gavage daily for 2 weeks.  Thyroid hormones were measured from plasma via radioimmunoassay and samples pooled for analysis for individual congeners (BDEs 28, 47, 66, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154) and internal plasma doses were calculated that corresponded with decreased free T4. This critical dose was estimated to be ~ 400 ug/g lipid BDE 47 based on significant reduction of free T4.

Hamers et al 2006, 2008 collectively found that OH-PBDEs act as agonists or antagonists at TH receptors, that OH-PBDEs with high affinity for T4 can be detected in human serum and all metabolites were found to be more potent than the natural ligand in vitro using rat liver microsomes (3-OH-BDE-47 was found to have the highest potency).

Lau et al 2007 and Chang et al 2008 reported that PFOS alters serum T4 via interference with binding proteins, leading to a transient increase in free T4 and decrease in TSH.

Weiss et al 2009 were the first to examine the potential of 24 perfluorinated compounds and 6 structurally-related fatty acids to compete with T4 for TTR via [125I]-T4 binding assay and HPLC-MS/MS analysis.  From this analysis, 56 chemical descriptors to evaluate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of binding potency of perfluorinated compounds to TTR.  Binding potency was found to strengthen with degree of fluorination, with maximum potency found at a chain length of eight (8) carbons; however, in general, the perfluorinated compounds were found to have T4 binding potency at about 10% that of the natural ligand.

Cao et al 2010 looked at binding interactions for 14 OH-PBDEs with TTR and TBG using fluorescence probe &amp; competitive binding assay, circular dichroism (spectroscopic measurement of a protein&rsquo;s secondary structure) and molecular docking analyses.  Binding constant data was generated for the first time and affinity was observed to increase with degree of bromination, until a peak at the 5- and 6-brominated diphenyl ethers was reached.  CD analysis showed that the OH-PDBEs bind to TTR and TBG at the same sites as the natural ligand while the molecular docking studies revealed a ligand-binding channel in TTR that was mostly hydrophobic inside but characterized by a positive-charged Lys15 residue at the channel entrance. The novel binding constant allowed meaningful quantitative evaluation of competitive displacement, by assuming human serum levels reported in the literature (Athanasiadou et al 2008; Marchesini et al 2008) and choosing the congener with the highest potency (5-OH-BDE47).  This evaluation suggested that competitive displacement would be insignificant, as serum levels of protein-bound 5-OH-BDE47 are at least two orders of magnitude lower than protein-bound T4 (suggesting ~10% T4 displacement by 5-OH-BDE47).

Cao et al 2011 generated binding constant data for the interactions of BPA and TH for TTR, TBG and human albumin via fluorescence probe, noting that concentrations of BPA commonly reported in human plasma are likely not high enough to interfere with T4 transport in serum.  A large excess of TTR and albumin in plasma are found relative to T4 and BPA and there is no competition for binding, which is further supported by the fact that affinity of BPA for T4 is much weaker than the natural ligand (by 2-3 orders of magnitude).

Ren and Guo 2012 designed a fluorescin T4 conjugate for use as a fluorescence probe in binding assays to examine interaction between eleven OH-PBDEs and transport proteins TTR and TBG. 3-OH-BDE47 and 3&rsquo;-OH-BDE154 were found to be competitive with T4.

Ren et al 2013  higher brominated OH-PBDEs act as antagonists (i.e. BDEs 154 and 188) while lesser bromination (i.e. BDEs 47) found to be agonists

Grimm et al 2013 used fluorescence probe displacement and molecular docking simulations to characterize the binding of sulfated PCB metabolites to TTR, and stability and reversibility of these complexes were characterized by HPLC. The hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs) are excellent substrates for sulfation (phase II conjugation) via sulfotransferases (SULTs) and thus could represent another mechanism through which clearance can occur. Of the five lower-chlorinated sulfates for which Kd values were generated and compared against T4, only one would be considered a competitive inhibitor (4&rsquo;PCB 11 sulfate) and the only case where the sulfate displays higher affinity than its corresponding OH metabolite (4&rsquo; OH-PCB 11).   Molecular docking simulation confirmed the affinity that PCB sulfates have for TTR, confirming previous reports showing higher affinity among those congeners with meta- and para-chlorination.  These data demonstrate the toxicological relevance of PCB sulfates to TTR-mediated transport of thyroid hormones in serum for the first time.  The generation of sulfates from OH-PCBs could be another mechanism through which PCBs may disrupt thyroid homeostasis.

Weiss et al 2015 compiled a database of 250 compounds and mixtures (including 33 never tested before), of which 144 were TTR binders and 36% (n=52) of these were found to be more potent than the natural ligand T4. The vast majority of these 52 (n=48) were aromatic, halogenated and hydroxylated. A subset of 220 compounds was further analyzed via PCA and a set of chemical descriptors to understand the chemical characteristics of TTR binders and four significant components were found to explain 85% of the variance.

Zhang et al 2015 developed a QSAR model and applied to a database of almost 500 dust contaminants taken from literature data and over 400 in silico derived metabolites, predicting 37 contaminants and 230 metabolites as potential TTR binders.  Twenty-three (23) contaminants were than analyzed via radioligand binding assay which identified four novel TTR ligands that were then analyzed via molecular docking studies."

Kohrle et al (1989) administered 2 umol of EMD 21388 per 100g BW in a single ip injection to euthyroid adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rat serum was analyzed for T3 and T4 content via species-adapted RIA and percent free TH was determined via equilibrium dialysis. Serum T4 decreased significantly following 1 hr or administration and remained low for several hours, while % free T4 increased significantly at 1 hr and remained elevated. {insert Figure 5} Previously, both in vitro and in vivo electrophoretic data showed complete inhibition of radiolabeled T4 binding to TTR. Administration of EMD 21388 to rats did not impact T3 concentrations or deiodinase activity.

Lueprasitsakul et al (1990) also administered EMD 21388 to euthyroid adult male Sprague-Dawley rats as a single 2 umol ip injection with additional time points as well as a single injection of 0.3 umol. In addition, one treatment group were exposed to varying doses from 0.2 to 2 umol EDM21388 per 100 g BW. Significant decreases in radiolabeled T4 bound to TTR were found within 3 minutes, reaching a maximum at 10 minutes. A simultaneous increase in % free T4 was noted at 3 minutes and reached a maximum at 10 minutes. {insert Figure 3} These effects were observed for both the high dose of 2 umol and the low dose of 0.3 umol; however, it was noted that % T4 bound to TTR recovered to almost control levels after 3 hours at the low dose. The authors concluded that EMD 21388 administration increased both the free T4 concentration as well as the albumin-bound T4 (which is available in serum and can play a greater role in transport when needed).

Mendel et al (1992) performed additional kinetic studies with radiolabeled T4 and albumin using Sprague-Dawley rats receiving a single ip injection of 2 umol EMD 21388. To overcome the dilution effect found with equilibrium dialysis, ultrafiltration of undiluted serum was employed to measure the % free T4. The % free T4 increased significantly at 20 minutes and the compensatory response of albumin appears to have been saturated after 20 minutes, as shown by the plasma disappearance curve for radiolabeled albumin. {insert Figures 2 and 3} The authors concluded that these data did not confirm TTR is a major carrier of T4 from plasma to liver and other tissues; however, these data also did not distinguish between whether transfer in vivo could be via albumin or from the free pool of T4 in serum.

Chanoine et al (1992) administered low (0.3 umol) and high dose (2 umol) EMD 21388 to Sprague-Dawley rats via single ip injection and a second treatment group had radiolabeled T4 injected 15 minutes following the EMD 21388 adminisatration. Both doses produced a similar significant increase to free T4 in serum within 15 minuteas of administration. {insert Figure 1} Binding of T4 to albumin in serum increased an order of magnitude in both high and low dose treatments.

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/960","Increased, Uptake of thyroxine into tissue","KE 960","T4 (and T3) is actively transported across the cell membrane into target tissues through the action of specific carrier-mediated uptake (simple diffusion probably plays a minor role), where it is T3 that binds to and triggers the nuclear receptors in the target cells (Yen 2001, Zoeller et al 2007). The T3 supply is met via secretion from the thyroid (20%) and through conversion of T4 into T3 (80%) through the action of outer-ring deiodinase enzymes D1 and D3 (Chopra 1996 from Zoeller et al 2007). THs are cleared from serum by the liver following sulfation (via sulfotransferase enzymes) or glucuronidation (via UDP-glucuronosyl transferase enzymes) and ultimately, eliminated in the bile (Hood and Klaasen 2000).

Two major groups of transporters have been identified: organic anionic transport proteins (OATPs) and amino acid transporters (L- and T-type). Several of these transporters have displayed greater affinity and selectivity for T4 and T3 and specific compounds (such as polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diethyl ethers) have been found to bind to the transport proteins either in serum or in various cellular compartments (Zoeller et al 2007)

OATPs transport both iodothyronines as well as sulfated conjugates and the gene family (SLCO) coding for this family of homologous proteins is clustered on human 12p12 (Hagenbuch and Meier 2004). OATP1A2 is expressed in brain, liver and kidney while OATP1B1, -1B2, and -1B3 are expressed in the liver and display high affinity for both T4 and T3 (Friesma et al 2005). OATP1C1 shows binding preference for T4 over T3 and is almost exclusively expressed in brain capillaries, where it is thought to play a role for transport of T4 across the blood brain barrier (Tohyama et al 2004).

There is also evidence that L-type or T-type amino acid transport proteins also play a role in cellular uptake of thyroid hormones. The former transport large neutral branched-chain and aromatic amino acids while the latter are specific to the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr and Trp (Visser 2010). The T-type amino acid transport protein TAT1 has been cloned from both rats and humans, is encoded by SLC16A10, and is a member of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family (MCT10)(Kim et al 2002). Both MCT and MCT8 share a high degree of homology and are both highly effective iodothyronine transporters. MCT8 is highly selective for T4 and T, responsible for transporting T3 into neuronal cells and interferes with brain development if absent (Friesma et al 2003, 2006 and 2008). MCT8 is expressed in multiple tissues, including liver, kidney, heart, brain, placenta, thyroid, skeletal muscle and adrenal gland, while MCT10 is also expressed in various tissues, with high expression in muscle, intestine, kidney and pancreas and the former is known to only transport iodothyronine molecules while the latter can also carry aromatic amino acids (Nishimura et al 2008). In terms of transport efficacy, MCT10 appears to be superior to MCT8 for moving T3; however, the reverse is true for T4.

Uptake into hepatocytes is probably mediated through multiple low-affinity/high-capacity and high-affinity/low-capacity processes that can be inhibited by certain molecules, such as fatty acids, bilirubin and indoxyl sulfate (Henneman et al 2001). Km values for these processes are in the micro- to nanomolar range, while the serum concentrations of free T4 and T3 are in the picomolar range.

 

Accumulation in tissue as well as transport across the placental and blood-brain barrier is dependent on expression level of the various TH membrane transporters, such as those in the MCT and OATP families. MCT8, MCT10, L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 are responsible for transplacental transfer of TH (Loubiere et al 2010), while MCT8 and OATP1C1 are important to transfer across the blood-brain barrier (Roberts et al 2008).

OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 show preference for sulfated THs and are expressed only in the liver

OATP1C1 shows high preference for T4 and almost exclusively expressed in brain capillaries and choroid plexus (Hagenbuch 2007)

LAT1 and LAT2 facilitate bidirectional transport of both T4 and T3 (and aliphatic and aromatic amino acids) across the plasma membrane

MCT8 only transports THs and expressed in choroid plexus, MCT10 also transports aromatic amino acids

Schroder van der Elst et al 1997 injected female rats with synthetic flavonoid [125I]-EMD 49209 and [131I]-T4 (or rats pretreated with EMD 21388), noting rapid clearance of [125I] from serum and rapid uptake of [131I] into tissues. These results show that the flavonoid itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier, despite the fact that they demonstrate displacement of T4 from TTR and temporarily increase the pool of available free T4. 

Schroder van der Elst et al 1998 injected pregnant rats at GD 20 with [125I]-EMD 49209 and observed distribution in maternal tissues, intestinal contents and fetal tissues. No flavonoid was detected in the brain but it was found in all fetal tissues examined, including brain.

 

 

 

TRANSPORT ACROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER

Active transport is required for uptake of T3 and T4 across cell membranes (Heuer 2007). Accumulation in tissue as well as transport across the placental and blood-brain barrier (BBB) is dependent on expression level of the various TH membrane transporters, such as those in the MCT and OATP families. MCT8, MCT10, L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 are responsible for transplacental transfer of TH (Loubiere et al 2010), while MCT8 and OATP1C1 are important to transfer across the blood-brain barrier (Roberts et al 2008).  Visser et al 2008 proposed that OATP14 is mainly responsible for moving T4 into the brain/CSF, where it is converted into T3 locally and transported into neurons via MCT8.

Schreiber et al 1995; Schreiber 2002

Roberts et al 2008 examined the expression of MCT8 and OATP14 in male Sprague Dawley rats, male CD-1 mice and human brain tissue via qPCR and immunofluorescent staining as well staining and confocal microscopy in isolated cerebral microvessels and choroid plexus (CP) epithelium.  They observed that the main transporter at the BBB is OATP14 whereas MCT8 mediates TH uptake into neuronal cells.  MCT8 mRNA and proteins were expressed in cerebral microvessels in all species; however, OATP14 mRNA and protein was only enriched in mouse and rat microvessels.  In all species, MCT8 is concentrated on the epithelial cell apical surface and OATP14 primarily on the basal-lateral surface of the CP epithelial cells.  These data suggested MCT8 plays a role in TH transport across the BBB and this is supported by the pattern of localization of the two transporters.

 

Kim et al 2015 screened protein transporters in rat serum for the potential to guide nanoparticles across the BBB (via receptor-mediated transcytosis, or RMT) using an in vitro transcytosis assay using rat and human brain microvascular endothelial cells.  Eleven (11) proteins were identified as showing potential to penetrate the endothelial cell layer via RMT, including Ttr.  Ttr was then incorporated into a quantum dot nanoparticle, administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats via IV and found to cross the BBB in rats via transcytosis, confirmed by in vivo imaging, TEM, ICP-MS and confocal microscopy.

 

TRANSPORT ACROSS PLACENTA

There is a direct role for maternal TH in the development of the fetal CNS starting with the 1st trimester and this maternal TH must be provided to the fetus via transplacental delivery (Chan et al 2002; de Escobar et al 2004).  The placenta responds to TH with both the villous and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) expressing specific nuclear receptor isoforms for T3.  The primary barrier of cells for maternal-fetal exchange are the syncytiotrophoblasts of placental villi, which are in direct contact with maternal blood, and the cytotrophoblasts, which form an additional inner layer of cells (Benirschke et al 2000).  Free T4 is the believed to be the primary TH transported across the placenta and fetal free T4 levels reach ~ 40-50% of maternal concentrations by the early 2nd trimester and peak in the early 3rd trimester, where they remain at levels higher than the corresponding maternal concentration (Calvo et al 2002; Hume et al 2004).

Accumulation in tissue as well as transport across the placental and blood-brain barrier is dependent on expression level of the various TH membrane transporters, such as those in the MCT and OATP families. MCT8, MCT10, L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 are responsible for transplacental transfer of TH (Loubiere et al 2010), while MCT8 and OATP1C1 are important to transfer across the blood-brain barrier (Roberts et al 2008).  The MCT8, OATP4A1 and LAT1 are localized at the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblasts while MCT10 is localized in the cytotrophoblasts during the 1st trimester (Ritchie and Taylor 2001; Sato et al 2003; Chan et al 2006; Loubiere et al 2010)

Displacement of T4 from transport proteins during the developmental stage could have consequences for both fetal development and later in adulthood (Morse et al 1996).  Transfer of maternal TH across the placenta is essential to neurodevelopment and even temporary disruption during the perinatal period can have long-term adverse health effects (Zoeller and Rovet 2004). Animal studies have confirmed that perinatal exposure to PBDEs can adversely affect neurodevelopment of CNS; however, the mechanisms remain elusive and the evidence in humans that hydroxylated metabolites of PBDEs is equivocal (Costa et al 2014).

TTR mediates transport through the placenta and the hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs and PBDEs have been found to more potent than the natural ligand T4 and thus, competitive binders. The presence of these compounds in maternal and infant blood have been associated with changes in TH, developmental endpoints and fertility in humans (Chevrier et al 2010, Harley et al 2010, Koopman-Esseboom et al 1994).  Several studies have demonstrated links between decreased T4 levels and neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral adverse outcomes in mice exposed specifically to BDE-99 (Branchi et al 2002; Viberg et al 2002).

Darnerud et al 1996 treated pregnant C57BL and NMRI mice on GD 13 with a single gavage at two doses of [14C]-labelled 3,3&rsquo;,4,4&rsquo;-tetraCB (PCB 77) and experiment was terminated after 4 days, measuring radioactivity and TH in maternal and fetal liver and plasma. Competitive binding assay was also done with [125I]-T4 complex from samples of fetal and maternal plasma. Dose-dependent uptake of [14C] were noted in both maternal and fetal plasma and liver, with fetal plasma radioactivity levels being 4- to 9-fold higher than maternal levels and corresponded to a single metabolite (4-OH-tetraCB).  Gel electrophoresis confirmed the [14C] was bound to fetal serum TTR and the fetal sera samples at the top dose (10 mg/kg) showed 50% TTR binding relative to controls, along with significant decrease in free and total serum T4.

Morse et al 1996 (also see Morse et al 1993) treated Wistar rats with Aroclor 1254 at 2 doses via daily oral exposure from GD 10 to 16, with blood and tissue (brain, liver) collected from dams and fetuses on GD 20 with pups reared until PND Day 21 (with blood and tissue collected at PND 4 and 21).  The biological samples were analyzed for TH, type II deiodinase activity and levels of PCBs and metabolites.  Maternal exposure to Aroclor 1254 significantly reduced both free and total T4 in the serum of fetus and neonate (Day 4) in a dose-dependent manner (but less pronounced at PND 21 and absent at Day 90). At GD 20, levels of T4 in fetal forebrain and cerebellum, and at PND 21 female weanlings at the high dose (25 mg/kg) still had significantly decreased forebrain T4.  In the fetus, deiodination (T4 to T3) was significantly increased in forebrain and in the female weanling, only at the low dose was deiodination significantly decreased. Similarly, glucuronidation was significantly decreased in the fetus and significantly increased in the female weanling. Accumulation of mainly one metabolite (2,3,3&rsquo;,4&rsquo;,5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol, or 4-OH-pentaCB; possibly from PCB 118 or PCB 126) was noted in fetal serum and forebrain as well as neonatal and weanling plasma and the concentrations of the metabolite in plasma relative to the more persistent parent congeners (PCB 153) were increased all the way to 90 days (and the plasma levels of the offspring exceeded that of dam all the way to 90 days).  These data show that maternal exposure to PCBs can result in accumulation of hydroxylated metabolites in fetal plasma that reduces T4 and, as a result, reduces brain levels of T4 with a compensatory increase in brain deiodination to maintain brain T3 concentration.

Pedraza et al 1996 treated pregnant Wistar rats first with methimazole (to block hormone synthesis) and then continuous infusion of EMD 21388 and T4 from GD 11 to 21, noting decreased total T4, increased free T4 and decreased T3 in maternal serum, increase of T3 in placenta and led to measurable amounts of parent compound in fetal serum along with decreased total T4 and increased T3.

Schroder van der Elst et al 1998 injected pregnant rats at GD 20 with [125I]-EMD 49209 and observed distribution in maternal tissues, intestinal contents and fetal tissues. No flavonoid was detected in the maternal brain but it was found in all fetal tissues examined, including brain.  It should be noted though that TTR is the principal carrier in the fetal rat and the EMD flavonoids were designed as T4 analogs and only bind to TTR (and not to albumin or TBG).  Shortly after birth, TTR production decreases to nearly zero and thus, interference with TTR-T4 during certain developmental windows might impact availability of thyroid hormone in certain tissues at critical time periods.

Sinjari and Darnerud (1998) injected C57BL mice on GD 16 with 5 doses of [14C]-labelled metabolites of PCB 77 (4-OH-tetraCB, two different 4-OH-pentaCB metabolites of PCB105), sacrificed 24 hours later, plasma and tissues collected from dam and fetus and analyzed for [14C], total T4 and liver microsomes.  Partial dose dependency was found for both maternal and fetal decreased total T4 for 4-OH-tetraCB and one of the pentaCBs.  Also, placental transfer to fetal plasma was dose dependent and, at lower doses (less than 5 mg/kg), fetal serum levels of 4-OH-tetraCB were 2-fold higher than maternal serum levels.  The authors conclude that doses in excess of 5 mg/kg saturate ligand binding, as effects measured at concentrations higher than this are not dose-related (however, there was extensive biliary excretion of 4-OH-tetraCB at the highest doses (20 and 50 &micro;mol/kg).  These results suggest that hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs are transferred to fetus upon maternal exposure, but did not induce a CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 response in the dam and competitive binding with T4 may not be the only mechanism behind noted adverse fetal effects from T4 modulation.

Meerts et al 2002 treated pregnant rats with 5 mg/kg of 4-OH-CB107 (radiolabeled and non-labelled) on GD 10 to 16, noting accumulation in the fetal compartment. The complex between TTR and [14C]-4-OH-CB107 was detected in serum in both dam and fetus.  Total and free serum T4 were reduced in fetus at GD 17 and 20. T4 concentration in fetal forebrain homogenate was reduced at GD20 and deiodination of T4 to T3 was increased at GD 17.  No changes were noted in maternal or fetal hepatic UDP-UGT activity, type 1 deiodination, or EROD activity.  These data show that TTR-mediated transport of xenobiotics, like the metabolites of PCB 107, can result in transfer from mother to fetus and can result in reduced fetal T4 (although it should be noted that fetal T3 remained unaffected). Furthermore, there was significant increase of fetal TSH at GD20, indicating stimulation of the HPT axis.

Inoue et al 2004 reported that PFOS can cross the placental barrier in humans

McKinnon et al 2005

Morse et al 2005 injected pregnant Wistar rats on GD 13 with single dose of [14C]-labelled 3,3&rsquo;,4,4&rsquo;-tetraCB (PCB 77) and tracked metabolism for 7 days.  The main metabolite was 4-OH-CB77 was found in maternal liver and plasma, placental tissue and fetal plasma, with 4-OH-CB77 accumulating 100-fold in fetus over the observation period with levels in fetal plasma being 14-fold higher than maternal plasma on GD 20. Similarly, while maternal serum T4 was initially significantly reduced and recovered by GD 20, the fetal plasma T4 was found to be significantly reduced relative to maternal T4 on GD 20. These data show that exposure to PCBs during pregnancy can result on transfer of metabolites to fetus (and these are competitive with T4 at the TTR binding site).

Riu et al 2008 fed pregnant Wistar rats with [14C]-decabromodiphenyl ether (DBDE) over 96 hr of late gestation (GD 16 to 19) and tissues analyzed via HPLC.  More than 19% of the administered dose was recovered, with 2/3 of this eliminated via feces, and results in accordance with past findings in Fisher and Sprague Dawley rats.  Small amounts were found to cross both the blood-brain and placental barriers and hydroxylated octaBDE was found in all tissues and fetus.

Dalliare et al 2009a looked at the relationship between TH status TBG and exposure to PCB-153, pentachlorophenol, hexachlorobenzene and hydroxylated PCBs in pregnant Inuit women and their infants. PCB-153 was the most predominant congener found to be elevated most in pregnant women, followed by infant and cord plasma levels.  OH-PCB results were a sum of 11 major congeners and found to be higher in pregnant women than cord blood, but highly intercorrelated.  Overall, the results suggest that the compounds measured in serum were not significant predictors of TH or TSH concentrations in this population.  The strongest results were found for PCP, which was negatively associated with free T4 in neonate cord blood, suggesting PCP reduces the transfer of T4 across the placenta. This confirmed previous findings of Sandau et al 2002, but has conflicted with other study populations and published reports; however, has biological plausibility as PCP has been reported to have a binding affinity twice that of the natural ligand for TTR (van den Berg 1990).

Loubiere et al 2010 described the ontogeny of TH transporters MCT8, MCT10, LAT1, LAT2, OATP1A2 and OATP4A1 in over 100 placenta samples collected across gestation via RNA extraction and qRT-PCR.  These mRNA data showed increasing expression of MCT8, MCT10, OATP1A2 and LAT1 throughout gestation, while OATP4A1 and CD98 (associated with LAT activity) mRNA fell to a nadir in the late 1st and early 2nd trimester. Immunohistochemistry data localized MCT10 and OATP1A2 for the first time to EVTs as well as syncytiotrophoblasts."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/961","Increased, Clearance of thyroxine from serum","KE 961","Thyroxin (T4) and T3 are metabolized and cleared from tissues in a number of ways: inner ring or outer ring deiodination via specific enzymes, conjugation (glucuronidation or sulfation), oxidative deamination and ether-linked cleavage (Zoeller et al 2007).

Deiodination:

There are three types of deiodinase enzymes. D1 and D2 convert T4 to T3 by removing an iodine atom from the outer ring while D3 removes an iodine atom from the inner ring, converting T4 to reverse T3. Differential expression of these enzymes during brain development are critical to the functionality of thyroid hormone in different areas of the fetal brain.

Much of the T4 is carried to the liver, where it is transported across the cellular membrane, converted into T3 via deiodination as mediated by deiodinase enzymes, and it is this T3 that triggers the TH receptors found in the nucleus. Roughly 80% of the T3 needed is produced via outer-ring deiodination of T4, which &quot;activates&quot; T4 to T3 (as opposed to inner-ring deiodination, which &quot;degrades&quot; T4 to reverse T3 which is eliminated). About 30% of the T4 produced daily (~ 130 nmol) is converted to roughly 40 nmol of T3 (Visser 2012) via enzyme D1 (liver, kidney) while conversion to rT3 accounts for roughly 40% of T4 turnover and is mediated via enzyme D3 (brain, placenta, fetus).

Conjugation:

Glucuronidation and sulfation of T4 accounts for the rest of the metabolized T4 and leads to rapid elimination through bile. It is thought that 20% of daily T4 production is eliminated through biliary excretion of glucuronide conjugates. Glucuronidation is carried out by UDP-glucuronoyltransferase (UGT) enzymes (Hood and Klaassen 2000a, 2000b) and appears to be more important in murine species than in man (Henneman and Visser 1997) and sulfation of T4 is done largely through an initial inner ring deiodination step (via D3). Circulating levels of THs in serum can be affected by compounds that induce the activity of UDP-UGT enzymes.

Uptake into the liver involves &quot;high affinity, low capacity&quot; and &quot;low affinity, high capacity&quot; processes with Km values in the nano- to micro-molar range (as opposed to the free T3 and T4 concentrations, which are in the picomolar range) (Henneman et al 2001 from Visser 2010). Both MCT8 and MCT 10 can transport THs; however, MCT8 is expressed in human liver where MCT10 is not and MCT8 display higher efficacy of cellular uptake and efflux relative to T3 (Ref 12 in Visser 2010).

 

 

 

 

Data in animals for PCBs

Previous reports have been made showing serum TH decreases in rats and mice in response to PCBs, PCB congeners and TCDD and these decreases have been thought to be driven by UDP-UGT (particularly 1A1 and 1A6)(Barter and Klaassen 1994, Schuur et al 1997, Van Birgelen et al 1995, Visser 1996)

Hallgren et al 2001, Hallgren and Darnerud 2002 showed that both T4 and T3 are significantly decreased following exposure to PCB mixtures or individual congeners.

Kato et al 2003 (and Kato et al 2002) showed for the first time that a commercial PCB mixture (Kanechlor-500, KC500) decreased serum TH without an increase in glucuronidation of T4. Male Wistar rats and ddy mice were given a single ip injection of 100 mg/kg and 4 days later, organ weights were measured and microsomal enzymes measured.  Significant increases were noted for both endpoints in both species; however, treatment with PCBs led to significant increases in UDP-UGT activity in rats but not mice. Gene expression of UDP-UGTs was also examined and, again, rats (but not mice) displayed time-dependent increases in levels of UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 following treatment with PCBs.  This agrees with past reports showing that clofibrate, phenobarbital, pregnenolone-16-alpha-carbonitrile and beta-naphthoflavone decrease serum TH and increase hepatic UDP-UGT activity in rats but not mice (Viollon-Abadie et al 1999).  

This implies that mice may reduce serum TH through a mechanism that does not involve increased glucuronidation, but may involve a TTR-associated pathway (as hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs have been displayed high affinity for TTR in in vitro studies).  Kanechlor-500 does not display any appreciable amount of outer ring deiodination activity (which would convert serum T4 to T3) and treatment with the mixture did not significantly change TSH levels (indicating there is no induction of the thyroid feedback loop from the measured decreases in serum TH). 

Kato et al 2004 performed the same experiment next with Wistar and Gunn rats, the latter species being a Wistar mutant strain that lacks UGT1A isoforms.  Both species showed serum T4 (free and total) decrease after single injection of either KC500 or pentaCB and only Wistar rats showed an associated increase in UDP-UGT activity. Significant decrease in type I deiodinase was observed in both rats in addition to detection of hydroxylated PCB metabolites bound to TTR.  Gunn rats treated with clofibrate also showed decreased serum T4 without an increase in UDP-UGT activity (Visser et al 1993).  These results imply that decreases of serum TH by PCB or pentaCB were managed by formation of OH-PCB metabolites that were then transported by TTR.  This is supported by the fact that the main metabolite found in KC500-treated rats was 4-OH-2,3,3&rsquo;,4&rsquo;,5-pentachlorobiphenyl, which displays a binding affinity towards TTR that exceeds that of T4 by more than 3-fold (Meerts et al 2002).  In fact, the dihydrohxylated PCBs show several fold higher affinity than the monohydroxylated PCBs (Lans et al 1993).  It should be noted that an increase in sulfation via SULT enzymes may also offer an esxplanation for the observed results.

Kato et al 2007 treated Wistar and Gunn rats with KC500 at a lower dose (10 mg/kg) once daily for 10 days, noting decrease in total and free serum T4 as well as the differential UDP-UGT response across the different strains.  Clearance of [125I]T4 from serum was higher in both species treated with KC500 and accumulation in several tissues, particularly the liver, was observed.  These data imply that reduction of serum TH from exposure to KC500 would be mediated through accumulation in the tissues and not through an increase in glucuronidation.  In addition, competitive inhibition by PCB or its metabolites with serum transport proteins (like TTR) could also decrease serum T4 by inducing a change in tissue distribution, especially the liver where more than 40% of[125I]T4 accumulated following treatment.

Kato et al 2009 treated C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice with the heptaCB metabolite 4-OH-CB187, decreasing free and total serum T4 with no observed UDP-UGT activity or effect on TSH.  A number of OH-PCBs have been identified in human serum, including 4-OH-CB107, 3-OH-CB153, 4-OH-CB146, 3&rsquo;-OH-CB138 and 4-OH-CB187 (which specifically has a 5-fold higher affinity for TTR relative to T4)(Hovander et al 2002).  Levels of [125I]T4-TTR were decreased with accompanying increases in binding to TBG and albumin in both strains of mice. Finally, T4 levels increased in tissues, particularly the liver and kidney.  Decreases in total and free serum T4 mediated by 4-OH-CB187 were observed in wild-type and TTR-heterozygous mice but not in TTR-deficient mice, with heterozygous mice displaying a smaller decrease in T4 relative to TTR-deficient mice.  In both strains of mice, treatment with 4-OH-CB187 promoted clearance of [125I]T4 from serum relative to controls and serum pharmacokinetic data were estimated, along with tissue-to-serum (Kp value) concentration ratios and [125I]T4 tissue distribution levels. These data imply that 4-OH-CB187 inhibits formation of the [125I]T4-TTR complex, which may lead to a change in tissue distribution, with accumulation in the liver and kidney mainly.

Kato et al 2012 treated C57BL/6 (wild type) and TTR-null mice with single ip injections of pentaCB at 112 mg/kg, noting significant decreases in total serum T4 and T4-TTR complex and measuring [125I]T4 clearance from serum and accumulation in tissues.  Treatment with pentaCB resulted in decrease of [125I]T4-TTR and increase in [125I]T4-albumin and [125I]T4-TBG complexes in wild type mice, but not in TTR-deficient mice, although liver accumulation was noted in both strains independent of UDP-UGT activity.  These data imply that penta-CB mediated increases in T4 liver concentration occurs mainly through inhibition of efflux of T4 and/or promotion on influx of T4 into hepatic cells (which is a receptor mediated process independent of TTR transport at the liver).

Kato et al 2013 treated C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice with 50 mg/kg CB118 (pentaCB) in a single ip injection for 5 days, noting decreased serum T4 in both strains and decrease in TSH for the DBA/2 mice but not C57BL/6.   CB118-mediated changes in [125I]T4 complexes with TBG, albumin and TTR were only observed in C57BL/6 mice (and not DBA/2), despite [125I]T4 accumulation in the liver of both strains. It is thought that the strain differences are dependent on differences in induction of CYP1A enzymes responsible for the hydroxylation of PCBs (creating metabolites that display far greater affinity for TTR than the natural T4 ligand).

Martin and Klaassen 2010 treated male Sprague Dawley rats with Aroclors 1242 and 1254; PCBs 95, 99, 118, 126 or TCDD at 4 doses via gavage daily for 7 days, then measured serum TH via radioimmunoassay and induction of hepatic Cyp1a and Cyp2b.  This study was the first to examine all three classes of PCB congeners: TCDD-type (no chlorine substitutions in ortho position, high affinity for arylhydrocarbon receptor, induce Cyp1a, PCBs 77 and 126), PB-type (at least 2 ortho substitutions, low affinity for AhR, induce Cyp2b, PCBs 28, 95, 99, 101 and 153) or mixed type (1 ortho substitution, low affinity for AhR, induce both Cyp1a and Cyp2b, Aroclors and PCB 118).  This study showed that PB-type and mixed type PCB congeners are more effective than TCDD type in reducing serum T4, with Aroclor 1254 (mixed) and PCBs 99 (PB) and 118 (mixed) producing the greatest reduction in serum T4 (as well as T3).  Serum TSH was not affected by any compound.  Total and free serum T4 was decreased by all treatments in a dose-dependent manner; however marked reduction were noted following treatment with Aroclor 1254, PCB 99 and PCB 118. PCB 118 and 126 caused significant increase in Cyp1a activity while Aroclor 1254 and PCBs 99 and 118 significantly induced Cyp2b.  Thus, it appears TCDD type congeners induce CYP1A2 (EROD) activity and UGT-UDP activity in the liver (associated wth binding at AhR) while PB type congeners induce CYP1B2 (PROD) activity and do not induce UGT-UDPs in the liver (associated with increased tissue uptake).

The PB type congeners may induce Oatp1a4 activity to increase clearance from plasma and enhance tissue uptake. Guo et al 2002 reported increase of Oatp1a4 following treatment with PCB 99 (and a decrease following treatment with PCB 126, a TCDD type congener). There are also reports of PB type congeners that accumulate in the liver with little to no increase in glucuronidation or biliary excretion and no changes in serum binding proteins, such as PCB 153, which implies a possible induction of OATP hepatic cellular transport proteins (Kato et al 2011).

Martin et al 2012 treated male Wistar rats with Aroclors 1242 and 1254, PCBs 95, 99, 118 and 126 and TCDD via gavage one per day for 7 days, followed 24 hours later with injection of [125I]T4 and collection of urine, blood, bile and urine. No treatments increased urinary excretion of [125I]T4, but serum T4 was reduced in all treatments and biliary excretion increased following treatment of Aroclor 1254, PCBs 118 and 126, and TCDD as measured by induction of UDP-UGT activity in the liver. PCBs 95 and 99 (PB type congeners) did not induce UGT-UDP activity despite very large and rapid decrease of serum [125I]T4 by PCB 99.  These data imply that increased tissue uptake (perhaps through increased TH transport across cell membranes) is another mechanism by which serum T4 can be reduced. 

Kato et al 2013 showed that PCB 118 (mixed type) mediated changes in tissue distribution and transport proteins in C57BL/6 mice, but not DBA/2 mice.  Kato et al 2012 showed the same with synthesized 2,2&rsquo;,4,5,5&rsquo;-pentaCB (PCB 101, PB type). Kato et al 2014 showed that PCB 77 (TCDD type) mediated changes in tissue distribution and transport proteins in DBA/2 mice, but not C57BL/6 mice.

 

Erratico et al 2012 used pooled and single-donor human liver microsomes, human recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and CYP-specific antibodies to evaluate the oxidative metabolism of BDE-99.  Ten (10) hydroxylated metabolites were produced by human microsomes and identified via HPLC-MS/MS and rates of formation were determined, including several that are much more potent than the natural ligand.  All ten were found to be catalyzed solely by CYP2B6.  Previous studies had also shown formation of hydroxylated metabolites of BDE-99 by human hepatic preparations (Lupton et al 2009, 2010; Stapleton et al 2009); however, fewer OH-PBDEs and additional CYP enzymes were found in similar work done with rat microsomes (Erratico et al 2011).

Feo et al 2013 incubated BDE-47 and recombinant CYPs, measuring the metabolites via GC-MS/MS, as well as specific kinetic studies with BDE-47, CYP2B6 and pooled human liver microsomes.  Six (6) OH-PBDEs were found to be catalyzed by CYP2B6 and additional metabolites were identified upon GC-MS/MS (including the novel finding of dihydroxylated metabolites) and these metabolites have been previously found in human serum (Athanasiadou et al 2008; Qui et al 2009).  The kinetic studies showed that hydroxylation can occur at low concentrations and that CYPT2B6 has high affinity for BDE-47.  CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were also suggested to play minor roles in the formation of OH-PBDEs."

Mucin production in healthy airway provides an important role in trapping and removing bacterial and viral pathogens and particulates. Similarly, mucus layer in the intestinal epithelium provides first line of defense against physical and chemical hazards, notably ingested food and bacteria (Kim and Ho, 2010). In airways, major gel-forming secreted mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B are primarily involved in defensive function. MUC2 is the major intestinal mucin but is also expressed in the airway epithelium, and MUC19 is the major mucin in salivary glands (Lillehoj et al., 2013). Specialized mucin-producing goblet cells increase mucin production in respiratory tract in response to various irritants and stressors (Rogers, 2003). Many stressors specifically induce mucin mRNA and protein production through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway (Nadel, 2013). However, other signaling pathways, not necessarily requiring EGFR activation, via STAT6, FOXA2 and SPDEF have also been implicated in mucin overexpression (Turner and Jones, 2009).  

Evidence for Perturbation by Stressor 

Various stressors such as cigarette smoke (Shao et al., 2004, Takeyama et al., 2001), reactive oxygen species (Yu et al., 2011, Casalino-Matsuda et al., 2009), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Hewson et al., 2004), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) (Lee et al., 2011), ozone (Wagner et al., 2003), fine particulate matter (Val et al., 2012), allergens such as ovalbumin (Song et al., 2016), as well as bacteria and viruses (Dohrman et al., 1998, Hao et al., 2014, Zhu et al., 2009) increase mucin production in respiratory airways. Wide range of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1B, IL4, IL6, IL9, IL13, TNF, induce mucin production in different tissues, including respiratory and intestinal epithelium (Linden et al., 2008). Injection of the urban particulate matter into the middle ear cavity of rats increased MUC5AC and MUC5B expression in the middle ear mucosa (Park et al., 2014). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced mucin expression in human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBECs), colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29, etc (Liu et al., 2013, Smirnova et al., 2003)."

Serine-threonine protein kinase AKT, a multifunctional regulator of cellular processes like glucose metabolism and proliferation, can directly phosphorylate eNOS at Ser1177/Ser1179, leading to increased eNOS enzymatic activity and subsequent NO production (Dimmeler et al., 1999; Fulton et al., 1999). Inhibition of AKT or a mutation of the AKT phosphorylation site on eNOS attenuates eNOS phosphorylation and its activity, resulting in decreased NO bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction (Dimmler et al. 1999)"
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/979","Interference, nuclear localization of NFAT","KE 979","The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a substrate of calcineurin (CN) (Rao et al. 1997). A NFAT has an N-terminal with a plurality of SP motifs rich in serine and proline, which are controlled by means of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. There is a nuclear localization signal (NLS) held between these SP regions as well as a nuclear export signal (NES) in the N-terminal adjacent to the SP motifs (Beals et al. 1997, Zhu and McKeon 1999, Serfling et al. 2000). SP motifs ordinarily are phosphorylated, which covers the NLS and leaves the NES exposed, so that NFAT localizes in cytoplasm. When SP motifs are dephosphorylated by activated CN, the NLS is exposed and the NES is covered, thereby promoting nuclear localization of NFAT (Matsuda and Koyasu 2000, Zhu and McKeon 1999). When T-cell activation takes place, T-cell&ndash;receptor- mediated stimulus increases the intracellular concentration of calcium and activates a regulatory subunit (CnB), which subsequently induces a catalytic subunit (CnA) phosphatase activation, leading to dephosphorylation of NFAT thereby promoting nuclear localization of NFAT. CNI-immunophilin complexes inhibit CN phosphatase activation, thereby interfering with NFAT nuclear localization (Bhattacharyya et al.2011).

Concentration-dependent reduction of in vitro nuclear localization of NFAT was evident at concentrations from 0.1 nM (Jurkat T cells) or 10nM (human CD4+ T cells) and up to 1 &mu;M (1000 nM) under the conditions of 2 hours treatment (Maguire et al. 2013)."

Suppressing the production of these B-cell&ndash;related cytokines appears to impaire TDAR, as seen in the result of FK506 treatment (Heidt et al, 2009).

IL-2 and IL-4 are produced and secreted by helper T cells and play important roles in the development of TDAR. IL-4 affects maturation and class switching of B cells as well as proliferation, both of which induces/enhances T cell dependent antibody production. IL-2 promotes differentiation of B cells through IL-2 stimulates differentiation of the activated T cell into T cell called Th2 cell.

The anterior chamber is formed by evagination from the cranial end of the posterior chamber (Robertson et al., 2007). Dumbarton et al. (2010) showed that the anterior chamber of zebrafish has particularly closely packed and highly organized bundles of muscle fibres, suggesting that contraction of these muscles would reduce swim bladder volume. While it had previously been suggested that the posterior chamber had a more important role as a hydrostatic organ, this implies high importance of the anterior chamber for buoyancy. The anterior chamber has an additional role in hearing (Bang et al., 2002). Weberian ossicles (the Weberian apparatus) connect the anterior chamber to the inner ear resulting in an amplification of sound waves.

Biological state

Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ER&alpha;) is a receptor covalently bound by estrogens, which following the dimerization can translocate to the nucleus (Bj&ouml;rnstr&ouml;m and Sj&ouml;berg, 2005), where it can bind to estrogen responsive elements and recruit co-activators or co-repressors, which can attract co-regulatory proteins, like histone acetyltransferase, ubiquitin ligases, and protein remodelers (Thomas and Gustafsson, 2011) (Fig.1). A non-genomic signalling of Er&alpha; is described (Fig. 7), not requiring the dimerization for the induction of kinases and calcium flux (Levin, 2002; Vasudevan and Pfaff, 2008). The non-genomic action of ER&alpha; is able to regulate more genes (Gu et al., 2014). Both signalling pathways are important for the human organism (Pedram et al., 2014; Pedram et al., 2016).



The ER structure is composed by different domains (A-F) which are responsible for the binding to the ligands, the dimerization, the binding to the DNA and for the activation of transcription (Nilsson et al., 2001) (Fig. 8). The A/B domain, or activation function 1 (AF1) is responsible for transactivation and protein-protein interaction, and it acts independently of ligand binding. Then, there is the C-domain, which is responsible for DNA binding and receptor dimerization. The D-domain instead is the phosphorylation site or ER and has nuclear localization sequences. The E-domain, or activation function 2 (AF2) is the ligand binding domain and the site for the binding with co-activators and co-repressors (Ellmann et al., 2009). Lastly, the F-domain that prevents improper ligand activation and dimerization (Yang et al., 2008).



Therefore, ligand binding, dimerization and DNA binding processes are the first steps to inducing the transcription of target genes. But the ER activity largely depends also on the presence and recruitment of different co-activators and co-repressors. Once ER is bound to estrogen responsive elements, it can recruit different proteins that can favour or obstruct the action of the receptor (Thomas and Gustafsson, 2011). The main co-activators are the steroid receptor co-activators (SRC-1 and SRC-3), which are able to recruit co-regulatory proteins (Heldring et al., 2007). The main transcription factors that can be regulated by ER are activating protein 1 (AP1), specificity protein 1 (SP1), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), nuclear factor-&kappa;B (NF-&kappa;B) and p53 (Biswas et al., 2005; Bj&ouml;rnstr&ouml;m and Sj&ouml;berg, 2005; Fox et al., 2009).

Instead in absence of ligands, ER can be activated by the phosphorylation from protein kinases which are stimulated by hyperactive growth factor receptors (Britton et al., 2006). ER is also able to rapidly activate other pathways, namely MAPK, PI3K, EGFR, and SRC (Kousteni et al., 2001; Song et al., 2002; Razandi et al., 2004; Shupnik, 2004).

Biological compartment

ER&alpha; is mainly expressed in uterus, prostate (stroma), ovary (theca cells), testes (Leydig cells), epididymis, bone, breast, various regions of the brain, liver, and white adipose tissue (Dahlaman-Wright et al., 2006).

At the subcellular compartments, estrogen receptors (ERs), are localized in cytoplasm where they exist as monomers bound to heat shock proteins (HSPs). Estrogen binding alters receptor conformation and triggers release from the HSPs, thereby allowing receptor dimerization and translocation in the nucleus where these dimers bind to specific DNA sequences and recruit numerous co-factors to regulate gene transcription. Unliganded ER are also characterized as monomers in the nucleus and at the plasma membrane (Gourdy et al., 2018)

General role in biology

The main function of ER&alpha; is to mediate the action of estrogens, known to be involved in physiological pathological conditions (endometrial proliferation in menstrual cycle and endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women). This receptor is also involved in apoptotic and proliferative functions involving the MAPK/ERK pathway, mainly in breast cancer cells (Zheng et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). Another player involved in the increased proliferation induced by ER&alpha; is c-myc (Dubik and Shiu, 1992). The increased proliferation induced by ER has been linked to tumours (Thomas and Gustafsson, 2011). The interaction between estrogen and ER&alpha; and the increased proliferation has been proved in breast and uterine tissues (Ellmann et al., 2009)."

&quot;The characteristics evaluated to determine the strength/health of honey bee colonies, include adequate numbers of adult bees, presence of sealed and open brood, adequate amounts of stored pollen, nectar and sealed honey, the absence of pests and disease, and the presence of a queen that lays eggs in consistent and tight patterns, with limited eggless cells (Sagili and Burgett, 2011). If the colony is weakened by any one (or a combination) of these factors for an extended period, a critical point can be reached
that will lead to colony failure. Through honey bee population dynamics models, it has been demonstrated that loss of foragers leading to precocious foraging of young bees may restore the overall foraging capacity, but the brood rearing capacity of the colony might be reduced (Khoury et al., 2011). Further, as noted above, precocious foragers are less effective and resilient, causing the forager death rate to increase. The model predicts that sustained forager losses that reduce the force by two-thirds would place a colony at risk for failure (Khoury et al., 2011). Additionally, proper brood rearing is essential to the development of healthy adult bees.&quot;"
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/111","Agonism, Estrogen receptor","KE 111","Site of action: The molecular site of action is the estrogen receptor (ER). ERs are members of the steroid hormone receptor family which belongs to a group of nuclear receptors that are transcriptionally activated by ligands leading to downstream activation of many cellular processes. ERs are composed of three principal domains &ndash; N-terminal domain (NTD), DNA binding domain (DBD), and the ligand binding domain (LBD). ER binds to specific DNA sequences known as estrogen response elements (EREs); EREs are generally short sequences located in the promoter region but can also exist in introns or exons (Klinge, 2001). ER-mediated gene transcription is initiated by binding of the DBD to an ERE with two distinct transcriptional activation domains, AF1 and AF2, located on the NTD and LBD respectively (Kumar et al., 2011).

Responses at the macromolecular level: ER&rsquo;s bind to endogenous and exogenous compounds and are activated by endogenous ligands such as estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) and estriol (E3) (Ng et al., 2014). There are numerous compounds (e.g., natural or pharmaceutical estrogens, alkylphenols, organochlorine pesticides, phthalates, etc.) that can act as estrogen agonists or antagonists, and effectively mimic or block the natural effects of estrogens on the ER (Pillon et al., 2005; Schmieder et al., 2014).

ER is part of a multi-protein complex consisting of HSP 90, HSP 70, and immunophilins (Stice &amp; Knowlton, 2008). In this multi-protein complex HSP 90 is the dominant protein and its binding to ER is essential for ER conformational binding of 17&beta;-estradiol (Segnitz &amp; Gehring, 1997). When binding on the LBD receptor occurs ER dissociates from HSP 90 and leads to receptor dimerization which can either be homodimers from the same isoform (ER&alpha;-Er&alpha;) or heterodimers containing one unit from both isoforms (ER&alpha;-Er&beta;) (Fliss et al., 2000). The translocation of these dimers into the nucleus modulates gene transcription (Aranda &amp; Pascual, 2001)."

Inhibitory signals such as contact inhibition or TGF-&beta; (Polyak, Kato et al. 1994; Francis, Bergsied et al. 2009) stabilize the mechanisms limiting entry into the cell cycle. Proliferative signals such as those following progesterone or estrogen (Croce 2008; Weber, Desai et al. 2017) or compensatory proliferation after apoptosis (Fogarty and Bergmann 2017) relieve inhibition and enable cells to enter the cell cycle. Mutations that inactivate inhibitory signals (tumor suppressors) or activate proliferative signals (oncogenes) promote proliferation outside of the normal biological context (Gustin, Karakas et al. 2009; Francis, Chakrabarti et al. 2011; Hanahan and Weinberg 2011; Weber, Desai et al. 2017). Abnormal proliferation is typically met with apoptosis or senescence, so additional mutations or other mechanisms are required to escape these additional levels of control for proliferation to continue indefinitely (Garbe, Bhattacharya et al. 2009; Shay and Wright 2011; Fernald and Kurokawa 2013).

Proliferation increases mutations as DNA damage and replication errors become integrated into the genome (Kiraly, Gong et al. 2015). Proliferation can also promote the expansion of existing cells with proliferative mutations. Genomic mutations favoring further proliferation are positively selected from among the expanded cells, resulting in the accumulation of mutational errors and moving the organism further towards cancer.

This dynamic process is essential for various physiological functions, including vascular development, tissue repair, and angiogenesis (Michaelis, Fonseca)..

 

During migration, endothelial cells undergo a series of coordinated steps, including sensing chemotactic signals, altering their cytoskeleton to form protrusions (Extension of finger-like projections (filopodia) at the leading edge of the cell to sense the environment), adhering to the extracellular matrix through molecules such as integrins,contraction (pulling the cell forward using actin) and finally detachment for movement (Michaelis, Fonseca). These movements are crucial for the remodeling and maintenance of blood vessels. This is regulated by chemical signs (VEGG, integrins) and physical cues (Michaelis, Fonseca, Norton).

 

The role of endothelial cell migration is in (Michaelis, Fonseca).: 


	Angiogenesis: One of the primary roles of endothelial cell migration is in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. In response to signals from growth factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial cells migrate towards the site of angiogenesis, contributing to the expansion of the vascular network (Michaelis, Lamalis).
	Tissue Repair: Endothelial cell migration is crucial for repairing damaged blood vessels. In response to injury or inflammation, endothelial cells migrate to the site of damage, facilitating the restoration of vascular integrity (Michaelis).
	Vascular Development: During embryonic development, endothelial cell migration is essential for the formation and remodeling of blood vessels (Scarpa). This process helps establish the intricate vascular network required for organ development.
	Immune Response: Endothelial cells play a role in immune responses by facilitating the migration of immune cells across blood vessel walls to sites of infection or injury (Sturtzel).
	Lymphangiogenesis: Endothelial cell migration is involved in lymphangiogenesis, the formation of new lymphatic vessels. This process is crucial for fluid drainage, immune surveillance, and can also play a role in cancer metastasis (Pengchung).
	Wound Healing:Endothelial cells contribute to wound healing by migrating to the site of injury and participating in the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as neovascularization (Lamalis, Amersfoort).
	Cancer Metastasis: In cancer, endothelial cell migration is hijacked by tumors to support their growth and metastasis. Tumor cells release angiogenic factors, inducing the migration of endothelial cells to form new blood vessels that supply nutrients to the growing tumor (Lamalis)."

Ionizing radiation and RONS such as hydroxyl radicals or peroxide can create a range of lesions (a change in molecular structure) in the base of the nucleotide, with guanine particularly vulnerable because of its low redox potential (David, O&#39;Shea et al. 2007). The same stressors can also break the sugar (deoxyribose)-phosphate backbone creating a single strand break. Simultaneous proximal breaks in both strands of DNA form double strand breaks, which are considered to be more destructive and mutagenic than lesions or single strand breaks. Double strand breaks can generate chromosomal abnormalities including changes in chromosomal number, breaks and gaps, translocations, inversions, and deletions (Yang, Craise et al. 1992; Haag, Hsu et al. 1996; Ponnaiya, Cornforth et al. 1997; Yang, Georgy et al. 1997; Unger, Wienberg et al. 2010; Behjati, Gundem et al. 2016; Morishita, Muramatsu et al. 2016).

However, DNA lesions and single strand breaks can also be destructive and mutagenic.

Lesions and single strand breaks can also promote the formation of double strand breaks: replication fork collapse and double strand breaks sometimes occur during mitosis when the replisome encounters an unrepaired single strand break (Kuzminov 2001), and clustered lesions and closely opposed single strand breaks can also form double strand breaks (Chaudhry and Weinfeld 1997; Vispe and Satoh 2000; Shiraishi, Shikazono et al. 2017). Complex damage consists of any combination of closely opposed DNA lesions, abasic sites, crosslinks, single, or double strand breaks in proximity. While classically induced by ionizing radiation, there is also evidence that it can be induced by oxidative activity (Sharma, Collins et al. 2016) or even by a single oxidizing particle (Ravanat, Breton et al. 2014). Complex damage is more difficult to repair (Kuhne, Rothkamm et al. 2000; Stenerlow, Hoglund et al. 2000; Pinto, Prise et al. 2005; Rydberg, Cooper et al. 2005).

DNA damage and resulting repair activity can trigger a halt in the cell cycle, cell death (apoptosis), and cause permanent changes to DNA including deletions, translocations, and sequence changes. DNA damage is also associated with an increase in genomic instability - the new appearance of DNA damage including double strand breaks, mutations, and chromosomal damage following repair of initial damage in affected cells or in clonal descendants or neighbors of DNA damaged cells. The mechanism behind this long term DNA damage is not clear, but telomere erosion appears to play a major role (Murnane 2012; Sishc, Nelson et al. 2015). Genomic instability is more common and longer lasting following complex damage (Ponnaiya, Cornforth et al. 1997), and is influenced by multiple factors including variants in DNA repair genes (Ponnaiya, Cornforth et al. 1997; Yu, Okayasu et al. 2001; Yin, Menendez et al. 2012), RONS (Dayal, Martin et al. 2008), estrogen (Kutanzi and Kovalchuk 2013), caspases (Liu, He et al. 2015), and telomeres (Sishc, Nelson et al. 2015)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1196","Increased, Invasion","KE 1196","Cell invasion refers to the active movement of cells into and through tissues, barriers, or extracellular matrices (ECM) (Friedl). It involves a series of coordinated processes by which cells penetrate physical barriers, navigate through the extracellular environment, and potentially reach distant locations (Hynes). It is regulated by growth factors (VEGF), signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions.

 

Key Steps in Cell Invasion:


	Detachment: Detachment of cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or neighboring cells through interactions with adhesion molecules, including integrins and cadherins.
	Proteolysis: Degradation of ECM components by proteolytic enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), secreted by invasive cells. This process creates pathways for cell movement.
	Motility: Dynamic changes in the cell&#39;s cytoskeleton, involving the formation of actin-rich structures like lamellipodia and filopodia, which facilitate cell movement.
	Intravasation: Invasion of cells into blood vessels or lymphatic vessels, allowing them to enter the circulatory system and potentially spread to distant sites.
	Extravasation: Exit of invasive cells from the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels at a secondary site, facilitating colonization and the formation of secondary tumors.
	Adhesion: Cells form new attachments to the ECM at the leading edge, allowing for continued movement.


 

There are many roles for cell invasion: 


	Development and Tissue Repair: Cell invasion is crucial during embryonic development for processes such as tissue patterning and organ formation. In adults, invasion is essential for tissue repair and regeneration.
	Embryonic development: During development, cells migrate to form different organs and tissues, shaping the intricate structure of the organism (Heisenberg).
	Immune Response: Immune cells use invasion to migrate to sites of infection or injury, where they participate in immune responses.
	Angiogenesis: Endothelial cells migrate to form new blood vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients to growing tissues or healing wounds (Carmeliet, Lamalice).
	Wound Healing: Invasive migration of cells is essential for wound healing, allowing cells to move into the wounded area and contribute to tissue repair (Grinnell).
	Cancer Metastasis: In cancer, invasion is a hallmark of malignancy and a critical step in metastasis. Cancer cells acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissues, enter blood or lymphatic vessels, and establish secondary tumors at distant sites (Krakhmal)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/12","Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) Inhibition","KE 12","&quot;Acetylcholinesterase is found primarily in blood, brain, and muscle, and regulates the level of the neurotransmitter ACh [acetylcholine] at cholinergic synapses of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Acetylcholinesterase features an anionic site (glutamate residue), and an esteratic site (serine hydroxyl group) (Wilson, 2010; Soreq, 2001). In response to a stimulus, ACh is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to the receptor protein, resulting in changes to the flow of ions across the cell, thereby signaling nerve and muscle activity. The signal is stopped when the amine of ACh binds at the anionic site of AChE, and aligns the ester of ACh to the serine hydroxyl group of the enzyme. Acetylcholine is subsequently hydrolyzed, resulting in a covalent bond with the serine hydroxyl group and the subsequent release of choline, followed by a rapid hydrolysis of the enzyme to form free AChE and acetic acid (Wilson, 2010; Soreq, 2001).&quot; [From Russom et al. 2014.

In order to move several actions such as : cell&ndash;substrate adhesion, cell&ndash;cell adhesion, cell cortex rigidity (membrane and cytoskeleton), actin polymerization-mediated protrusion and actomyosin contractility (Stuelten, Lauffenburger, Montell).

Several key factors contribute to cell motility in cancer (Friedl, Lamouille, Sahail):


	Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamics: The actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in cell motility. Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell shape changes, protrusion formation, and cell migration. This process is tightly regulated by proteins such as actin polymerization factors, focal adhesion proteins, and myosin motors.
	Cell Adhesion and Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Interactions: Integrins and other cell adhesion molecules mediate the interaction between cancer cells and the ECM. These interactions activate signaling pathways that influence cell motility. Changes in adhesion molecules can enhance or inhibit the migratory potential of breast cancer cells.
	Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT): EMT is a biological process in which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics, including increased motility. EMT is associated with the invasive behavior of cancer cells, allowing them to detach from the primary tumor and migrate to distant sites.
	Chemotaxis and Gradients: Cancer cells can respond to chemical gradients, a process known as chemotaxis. Growth factors and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment can attract or repel cancer cells, influencing their direction of movement.
	Proteolytic Enzymes and Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs): Proteolytic enzymes, especially MMPs, are involved in degrading the ECM, facilitating cancer cell invasion. The degradation of the surrounding matrix creates space for cell movement and allows cancer cells to penetrate adjacent tissues.


In breast cancer, cell motility can favor metastasis through different steps: loss of epithelial polarity, breakdown of tissue architecture, breach of the basement membrane, intravasation, extravasation, migration into new tissues, and expansion of metastatic colonies (Stuelten). For instance, an increase in invasion of the surrounding tissues and blood vessels. Once cancer cells have invaded the local tissue, they may enter the bloodstream through a process called intravasation. Subsequently, they must migrate through the vasculature to reach distant organs, a process known as extravasation (Chambers). Once in the circulation, cells utilize chemotaxis, responding to chemokines and other signals in the microenvironment, to navigate through the bloodstream and reach specific distant organs. The ability of cancer cells to home in on specific organs depends on their motility and the interactions with the target tissue (Psaila, Labelle). Once cancer cells reach a distant organ, they need to extravasate and establish micrometastases. Motility enables cancer cells to navigate through the tissue, invade the local environment, and form secondary tumor foci (Nguyen)."

A mechanism explaining how astrocytes release glutamate is not well defined, but it could be released through exocytosis(Nedergaard et al. 2002). Glutamate is the main excitatory transmitter in the brain and spinal cord, where it activates both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. There are 3 main ionotropic receptor classifications, AMPA, Kainate, and NMDA receptors, which are always excitatory (Kandel et al. 2013: 213). Excessive extracellular glutamate release overactivates these signaling pathways, and propagates the excitotoxicity caused by some nerve agents (McDonough and Shih 1997)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1353","Binding to voltage-gated sodium channel","KE 1353","Due to their critical role in neuronal function, sodium channels are known molecular targets of neurotoxins and neurotoxicants (Caterall et al., 2012; Wakeling et al., 2012). The essentiality of sodium channels in nerve conduction comes from classic literature on tetrodotoxin (TTX). TTX is a sodium channel blocker that inhibits the firing of action potentials in neurons by binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC/NaV) in nerve cell membranes. This action blocks the passage of sodium ions into the neuron, ions responsible for the rising phase of an action potential (AP). There is strong evidence implicating a similar TTX-like of pyrethroid insecticides on VGSC. This block of VGSC is supported by an extensive body of literature on the action of pyrethroid insecticides on mammalian sodium channels. Binding studies using radioactive pyrethroid demonstrated specific binding of the pyrethroid to rat brain VGSC &alpha; subunits (Trainer et al., 1997).

Ion channels are integral membrane proteins that are critical for neuronal function. They form &quot;pores&quot; in the plasma membrane that allow certain ions to travel across the membrane along their electrochemical gradient. Ion channels that open in response to a change in membrane voltage potential are called &lsquo;voltage-gated&rsquo; ion channels. Channels that open in response to binding using a chemical signal or molecule are &lsquo;ligand-gated&rsquo; ion channels. In neurons, ion channels of both types are essential for chemical communication between cells, i.e., synaptic transmission. Ion channels also function to maintain membrane potential and initiate AP to propagate electrical impulses. VGSC are therefore responsible for AP initiation and propagation in most excitable cells, including nerve, muscle and neuroendocrine cell types. It is important to note that functional VGSC are present in both grey and white matter in the brain. Approximately 50% of white matter oligodendrocyte precursor cells receive synaptic inputs and can produce trains of VGSC-dependent APs (Fields, 2008). VGSC are also present on microglia where they contribute to the release of major pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hossain et al., 2017).

Mammalian VGSC are composed of one &alpha; and two &beta; subunits. Ten separate &alpha; subunits (Ogata and Ohishi, 2002) and four different &beta; subunits (Isom, 2002) have been identified and are expressed in tissue-, region- and time- specific manners. The diverse functional roles of VGSCs depend on the numerous potential combinations of &alpha; and &beta; subunits (Ogata and Ohishi, 2002). The type of VGSCs expressed in different cell types and regions, their sensitivity and their functional role, all contribute to the manifestation of toxicity and age-dependent sensitivity, of chemicals acting at this site."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1376","Increase, angiogenesis","KE 1376","Angiogenesis is the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from existing vessels. This complex and tightly regulated process involves the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells. 

 

Key Steps in Angiogenesis:


	Stimulus for Angiogenesis: Angiogenesis is triggered by specific signals, such as growth factors, released in response to tissue hypoxia, injury, or other physiological needs.
	Activation of Endothelial Cells: Endothelial cells in existing blood vessels become activated in response to angiogenic signals, leading to changes in gene expression and cell behavior.
	Proliferation and Migration: Activated endothelial cells proliferate and migrate toward the angiogenic stimulus, guided by chemotactic signals.
	Tube Formation: Endothelial cells organize into tube-like structures, forming capillaries. This process involves the creation of lumens within the tubes.
	Vessel Maturation: The newly formed vessels undergo maturation processes, including the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells. This maturation is crucial for the stability and functionality of the vasculature.
	Integration with Circulatory System: The newly formed blood vessels integrate into the existing circulatory system, providing increased blood flow to the target tissues.


 

Angiogenesis is regulated by both pro and anti-angiogenic factors. The most common pro angiogenic factors are VEGF and FGF (Folkman).

 

Angiogenesis is a fundamental mechanism in development, tissue repair, and various pathological conditions, including cancer : 


	Development: During embryonic development, angiogenesis is critical for establishing the vascular network necessary for organ and tissue formation (Ribatti).
	Tissue Repair and Regeneration: Angiogenesis plays a key role in tissue repair and regeneration after injury or damage. The formation of new blood vessels helps supply nutrients and oxygen to the healing tissue (Ribatti).
	Menstrual Cycle and Pregnancy: In the female reproductive system, angiogenesis is a normal part of the menstrual cycle and is essential for the development of the placenta during pregnancy (Hoier).
	Inflammatory Response: Angiogenesis is involved in the inflammatory response, facilitating the influx of immune cells to sites of infection or injury.
	Cancer Growth and Metastasis : In cancer, angiogenesis is hijacked by tumors to support their growth and metastasis. Tumors release pro-angiogenic factors, promoting the formation of new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to the growing cancer cells (Nishida).
	Ischemic Diseases: Angiogenesis is a therapeutic target in diseases involving inadequate blood supply, such as ischemic heart disease and peripheral artery disease (Ferrara)"

CYP7B is expressed in different organs including liver, prostate and brain.

How does it work :

CYP7B is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. It is involved in steroidogenic pathways as well as in the synthesis of bile acids. In the brain, it is involved in neurosteroids synthesis.

In the brain, the reactions catalyzed by CYP7B are : 


	Probably in all vertebrates: Pregnenolone into 7&alpha;-hydroxypregnenolone and its stereoisomer 7&beta;-hydroxypregnenolone (bird only) (R08943) (Matsunaga et al., 2004; Rose et al., 1997; Tsutsui et al., 2008)

In the human and mouse liver, CYP7B is responsible for (Toll et al., 1994): 


	5-cholesten-3-beta, 25(S)-diol into Cholest-5-ene-3 beta-7 alpha, 25-thiol (R07209 R08723),
	Cholest-5-ene-3 beta, 26-diol into 7 alpha, 27-dihydroxycholesterol (R07372 R08724),
	3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoate into 3 beta, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoate (R08727 R08728).
	It is expressed in the chicken liver and is probably involved in the same reactions (Handschin et al., 2005). 


In the prostate:

This thickening reduces the space in the blood vessels which is available for the blood flow (Widmaier, Raff, Strang, &amp; Vander, 2016).

Atherosclerosis is initiated with an endothelial injury that allows the translocation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) molecules to the intima layer of the artery, where they become oxidized (oxLDL). The endothelial cells release chemokines and adhesion molecules that recruits blood monocytes to the injury site, where monocytes cross to the sub-endothelial space. Monocytes then differentiate into macrophages and take up oxLDL, thus becoming laden with lipoproteins (&ldquo;foam cells&rdquo;). The lipid accumulation and foam cell formation continues over time, and the migration of smooth muscle cells from the media layer to the intima space helps establishing an atherosclerotic plaque with the release extracellular matrix molecules (Libby et al., 2019)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/149","Increase, Inflammation","KE 149","Inflammation is complex to define.  

Villeneuve et al. (2018) analyzed the varied biological responses, provided guidance to simplify the  process representing inflammation in adverse outcome pathways, and recommended 3 key steps: 1. Tissue resident cell activation 2. Increased Pro-inflammatory mediators 3. Leukocyte recruitment/activation.  Tissue resident cell activation generally occurs when healthy tissue is exposed to a stressor, or when damage occurs, initiating a signal response of pro-inflammatory mediators (ex. cytokines).  Pro-inflammatory mediators result in the production of lipids and proteins, signaling, and initiate leukocyte recruitment/activation.  Leukocyte recruitment/activation initiate inflammation and other morphological changes.  

In cancer, inflammation is a cascade of events created by the host in response to the spread of the cancer (Coussens and Werb, 2002). In response to an injury or the presence of cancer, the host heals itself through inflammation. Indeed, the activation and the migration of  leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils) to the wound induces the healing process. These inflammatory cells provide an extracellular matrix that forms upon which fibroblast and endothelial cells proliferate and migrate in order to recreate a normal environment. Damage to the epithelial layer initiate inflammatory reactions (Palmer et al. 2011).  In cancer, this inflammatory state induces cell proliferation, increases the production of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative DNA damage, and reduces DNA repair (Coussens and Werb, 2002).  For review of inflammation caused by microplastics in mammals, see Wright and Kelly (2017).

 

 

Inflammation can be defined as the response of the organism to a tissue injury (Coussens). Indeed, in order to heal this injury, a multitude of chemical signals initiate and maintain a host response. Leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils) are recruited to the site of the damage through the attraction by chemokines (TNF-&alpha; (tumour necrosis factor-&alpha;), interleukines&hellip;). A provisional extracellular matrix (ECM) is created, and fibroblast and endothelial cells proliferate and migrate to it. Wound healing is an example of physiological inflammation and is self-limiting (Coussens). In case of a dysregulation, inflammation can lead to pathologies. Inflammation can be caused by physical injury, ischemic injury, infection, exposure to toxins, or other types of trauma (Singh).

Inflammation was described as one of the hallmarks of cancer by Hannahan et al. as a response to tumor invasion through mainly two mechanisms: promoting genetic instatbility and supply pro-tumorogenic factors.

First, inflammation in cancer promotes genetic instability (Mantovani, colotta). Macrophages, in contact with the inflammatory site can be responsible of a reactive stress oxygen reaction (ROS) (Maeda, Pollard, Grivennikov). Indeed, they generate high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which produce mutagenic agents (peroxynitrite), which in turn causes DNA mutations.

Second, in inflammation, the tumor micro environment plays a critical role (Coussens). Indeed, in can supply growth factors, survival factors, proangiogenic factors, extracellular matrix-modifying enzymes that facilitate angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, and inductive signals that lead to activation of EMT and other hallmark-facilitating programs (Hannahan). For example, macrophages can become tumor associated macrophage which promote cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion (Singh, Lin, Qian).

Moreover, chronic inflammation can also lead to tumorigenesis (Karin, Singh). Indeed, since 1863, Virchow has hypothesized that chronic inflammation causes cell proliferation (Balkwill). According to Aggarwall, several pro-inflammatory markers such as TNF and members of its superfamily, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, chemokines, MMP-9, VEGF, COX-2, and 5-LOX mediate suppression of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (Aggarwal)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1524","Increase, Premature molting","KE 1524","This key event is measured on the level of the individual. In order to grow and develop, arthropods need to shed their exoskeleton periodically (molting) (Heming 2018). During molting, the newly secreted cuticle is subject to mechanical stress associated and therefore needs to possess enough structural and functional integrity. The ecdysis motor program, which constitutes the behavioral part of the cuticle shedding requires the newly secreted cuticle to possess a certain strength to support for muscular force in order to shed the old cuticle (Ewer 2005). Cuticular integrity is also important after ecdysis, as insects and crustaceans expand their new cuticle by increasing internal pressure by swallowing air and water, respectively. This happens in order to expand and provide stability to the new cuticle until it is hardened (tanned) (Clarke 1957; Lee 1961; Dall et al. 1978; deFur et al. 1985). If arthropods are not able to molt properly, the organism will eventually die. Premature molting describes the unsuccessful molting where the organism is not able to shed the old cuticle, but also other effects related to molting in an immature stage where the new cuticle is not mature enough for the molt, such as rupture of the new cuticle and associated desiccation, deformities, higher susceptibility to pathogens or impaired locomotion. Specific effects observed are animals stuck in their exuviae (Wang et al., 2019), and if molting can be completed despite an immature cuticle, animals might be smaller and die at subsequent molts (Arakawa et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2008; Mohammed et al., 2017)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1539","Endocytotic lysosomal uptake","KE 1539","Endocytosis was discovered by the Belgian Nobel laureate Christian De Duve in 1963.

Endocytosis is a form of active transport in which molecules are transported into the cell by engulfing them in an energy-using process. In endocytosis, the material to be internalized is surrounded by an area of plasma membrane, which then buds off inside the cell to form a vesicle containing the ingested material. The ingestion of large particles (generally &gt;250 nm in diameter) is termed phagocytosis (cell eating); phagocytosis is actin-dependent and restricted to professional phagocytes. The non-specific receptor-independent process to internalize fluids and solutes is called  pinocytosis (cell drinking; via small vesicles of about 100 nm in diameter) and found in all cells (Cooper, 2000; Alberts et al., 2002; Oh and Park, 2014).

Receptor-mediated endocytosis can be clathrin-, and caveolin-dependent; these proteins mediate the invagination of the cell membrane.

The clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway produces small (approx. 100 nm in diameter) vesicles coated with the cytosolic protein clathrin, forming clathrin-coated pits in the plasma membrane.

Caveolae-mediated endocytosis produces small (approximately. 50 nm in diameter) caveolae, flask-shape pits in the membrane coated with the protein caveolin, derived from lipid rafts (rigid membrane microdomains enriched with phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol). Clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis is further sub-classified as Arf6- dependent, flotillin-dependent, Cdc42-dependent and RhoA-dependent endocytosis (Cleal et al., 2013; Villamil Giraldo et al., 2014; Iversen et al., 2011; Sahay et al., 2010; Kirkham and Parton, 2005; Mailaender and Landfester, 2009).

Vesicles rapidly lose their coats and fuse to form larger compartments, known as endosomes.

Early endosomes are the first compartment of the endocytic pathway and receive most types of vesicles coming from the cell surface. Endocytosed material is transferred to late endosomes and further to lysosomes, vacuoles of 1-2 &micro;m in diameter containing hydrolytic enzymes in an acid milieu. Their main task is the degradation of ingested material (Villamil Giraldo et al., 2014).

Substances that are taken up selectively into lysosomes are called lysosomotropic agents (De Duve et al., 1974). These agents tend to have both lipophilic or amphiphilic compounds with basic moieties and accumulate in the acidic intracellular compartment, where they become protonated, therefore cannot diffuse back into the cytosol and accumulate within lysosomes, a phenomenon called &quot;acid trapping&quot; (Villamil Giraldo et al., 2014).

Although structurally and pharmacologically diverse, lysosomotropic compounds share certain

physicochemical properties, namely a ClogP &gt; 2 (partition coefficient of the neutral species of a compound between octanol and water) and a basic pKa (the negative base-10 logarithm of the acid dissociation constant of a solution; the lower the pKa value, the stronger the acid) between 6.5 and 11 (Nadanaciva et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2017)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1554","Increase Chromosomal Aberrations","KE 1554","The term &quot;structural chromosomal aberrations&quot; refers to chromosome damage caused by breaks in the DNA that can result in the deletion, addition, or rearrangement of chromosomal segments. According to whether one or both chromatids are affected, chromosomal aberrations can be classified into two main groups: chromatid-type and chromosome-type. Additionally, they can be divided into rejoined and non-rejoined aberrations. Translocations, insertions, dicentrics, and rings are examples of rejoined aberrations, whereas acentric fragments and breaks are examples of unrejoined aberrations (Savage, 1976). Some of these abnormalities, like reciprocal translocations, are long-lasting and can last for many years (Tucker and Preston, 1996). Others, such as dicentrics and acentric fragments, are unstable and weaken with each cell division due to cell death (Boei et al., 1996). After cell division, these activities might still be visible, and the DNA is irreversibly damaged. The occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities is linked to cancer development and cell death (Mitelman, 1982).

A missing, excess, or asymmetrical part of chromosomal DNA is referred to as a chromosomal aberration (CA). There are various double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms that could be responsible for these DNA modifications in the chromosome structure (Obe et al., 2002).

The four basic categories of CAs are inversions, translocations, duplications, and deletions. When a section of a chromosome&#39;s genetic material is destroyed, deletions take place. When a chromosome&#39;s end portion is cut, terminal deletions result.

When a chromosome splits into two different places and wrongly rejoins, leaving the middle portion out, interstitial deletions result. Duplications occur when excess genetic material is added to or rearranged; they can take the forms of transpositions, tandem duplications, reverse duplications, and misplaced duplications (Griffiths et al., 2000). A segment of one chromosome is transferred to a non-homologous chromosome in translocations (Bunting and Nussenzweig, 2013). A reciprocal translocation occurs when regions of two non-homologous chromosomes are switched. When an inversion occurs, the DNA sequence is effectively reversed because both ends of the chromosome split and are ligated at the opposite ends.

The copy number variant is a fifth type of CA that can exist in the genome (CNV). CNVs are deletions or duplications that can range in size from 50 base pairs (Arlt et al., 2012; Arlt et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013) up into the megabase pair range and may make up more than 10% of the human genome (Shlien et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2016; Hastings et al., 2009). (Arlt et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2015; Arlt et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). According to Wilson et al. (2015), CNV regions are particularly abundant in large active transcription units and genes, and they are especially problematic when they result in the duplication of oncogenes or the loss of tumor suppressor genes (Liu et al., 2013; Curtis et al., 2012). 

 

Recurrent and non-recurrent CNVs are two different types. Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), a recombination process that occurs during meiosis, is hypothesised to be the cause of recurrent CNVs (Arlt et al., 2012; Hastings et al., 2009). These germline CNVs, also known as recurrent CNVs, may be inherited and are hence prevalent in various people (Shlien et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2013). It is thought that non-recurrent CNVs are created in mitotic cells during the replication process. It has been proposed that replication-related stress, particularly stalled replication forks, triggers microhomology-mediated processes to break the replication stall, which frequently leads to duplications or deletions, despite the fact that the mechanism is not well understood.

Two models that have been proposed to explain this mechanism include the Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS) model, and the Microhomology-Mediated Break-Induced Replication (MMBIR) model (Arlt et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2007; Hastings et al., 2009).

Depending on whether the aberration affects the chromatid or the chromosome, CAs can be categorized. Chromosome-type aberrations (CSAs) are chromosome breakage and chromatid swaps; ring chromosomes, marker chromosomes, and dicentric chromosomes are examples of chromatid-type aberrations (CTAs) (Bonassi et al., 2008; Hagmar et al., 2004). Micronuclei (MN; small nucleus-like structures that contain a chromosome or a fragment of a chromosome that was lost during mitosis) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs; physical linkages between the two nuclei) are visible in binucleated cells when cells are halted at the cytokinesis step (El-Zein et al., 2014). The DNA sequence can be examined to evaluate other CAs, as it is for identifying copy number variants (CNVs) (Liu et al., 2013).

Essentiality of the key event

 

Chromosomal aberrations, such as mutations, deletions, and translocations, are indicative of genetic damage, which can result from exposure to genotoxic agents. This key event represents a mechanistic step that contributes to the overall progression of the pathway, helping to bridge the gap between the initial exposure and the manifestation of adverse effects.

By showcasing experimental evidence that supports the occurrence of increased chromosomal aberrations in response to the MIE, the AOP gains scientific credibility and biological plausibility. Studies demonstrating the genotoxic effects of certain substances provide empirical support for the connectivity of events within the pathway. For example, genotoxicity assays that detect structural changes in chromosomes can serve as evidence of chromosomal aberrations (e.g., Ames test, in vitro micronucleus assay).

Furthermore, the presence of increased chromosomal aberrations is indicative of potential genetic harm, which aligns with the adverse outcome. This insight aids in risk assessment and regulatory decision-making, as the occurrence of genotoxicity informs the evaluation of the potential health risks associated with exposure to certain agents.

Fischer et al., in their mRNA expression profiles showed that the tumor subtypes of neuroblastoma had significantly more segmental genomic imbalances, indicating that a combination of expression profiling (miRNAs and mRNAs) with analysis of DNA copy number alterations, will lead to improved prognostication of this often fatal tumor subtype (Fischer et al., 2010)"

The term lung cancer refers to all malignant neoplasms arising from the bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar epithelium (Keshamouni et al., 2009). The cellular origin(s) of lung cancer remains largely unknown. It has been speculated that different tumour histopathological subtypes arise from distinct cells of origin localized in defined microenvironments. Histological characteristics of lung cancers, as defined by light microscopy, have led to the categorization of lung cancers into four main subtypes: small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (Beasly et al., 2005). These histological subtypes are grouped under one of the two umbrella terms used to describe lung cancers:  small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The term SCLC refers to small cell carcinoma. The term NSCLC, which represents approximately 85% of all lung cancers (Molina et al., 2008), encompasses squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. These three tumour types are grouped together due to similarities in their prognosis and management (Keshamouni et al., 2009); patients with NSCLC often have poor prognoses and low 5-year survival rates due to the high metastatic potential of the tumours (Spira and Ettinger, 2004; Herbst et al., 2008). Some of the most common sites for lung cancer metastasis are the other lobe of the lungs, skeleton, adrenal glands, liver, and brain (Simon et al., 2015)."

The faster growing end of microtubules is called the plus end whereas the slower growing end is the minus end. The plus end is protected from rapid polymerisation by a GTP cap which is a ring of GTP-tubulin . However, when a new tubulin dimer is added to the plus end, GTP gets hydrolysed in the catalytic domain of &alpha;-tubulin and the tubulin subunit gets non-exchangeable.

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1636","Increase, Chromosomal aberrations","KE 1636","Structural chromosomal aberrations describe the damage to chromosomes that results from breaks along the DNA and may lead to deletion, addition, or rearrangement of sections in the chromosome. Chromosomal aberrations can be divided in two major categories: chromatid-type or chromosome-type depending on whether one or both chromatids are involved, respectively. They can be further classified as rejoined or non-rejoined aberrations. Rejoined aberrations include translocations, insertions, dicentrics and rings, while unrejoined aberrations include acentric fragments and breaks (Savage, 1976). Some of these aberrations are stable (i.e., reciprocal translocations) and can persist for many years (Tucker and Preston, 1996). Others are unstable (i.e., dicentrics, acentric fragments) and decline at each cell division because of clonogenic inactivation (Boei et al., 1996). These events may be detectable after cell division and such damage to DNA is irreversible. Chromosomal aberrations are associated with  clonogenic inactivation and carcinogenicity (Mitelman, 1982).

Chromosomal aberrations (CA) refer to a missing, extra or irregular portion of chromosomal DNA. These DNA changes in the chromosome structure may be produced by different double strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms (Obe et al., 2002).

There are 4 main types of CAs: deletions, duplications, translocations, and inversions. Deletions happen when a portion of the genetic material from a chromosome is lost. Terminal deletions occur when an end piece of the chromosome is cleaved. Interstitial deletions arise when a chromosome breaks in two separate locations and rejoins incorrectly, with the center piece being omitted. Duplications transpire when there is any addition or rearrangement of excess genetic material; types of duplications include transpositions, tandem duplications, reverse duplications, and displaced duplications (Griffiths et al., 2000). Translocations result from a section of one chromosome being transferred to a non-homologous chromosome (Bunting and Nussenzweig, 2013). When there is an exchange of segments on two non-homologous chromosomes, it is called a reciprocal translocation. Inversions occur in a single chromosome and involve both of the ends breaking and being ligated on the opposite ends, effectively inverting the DNA sequence.    
 

A fifth type of CA that can occur in the genome is the copy number variant (CNV). CNVs, which may comprise greater than 10% of the human genome (Shlien et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2016; Hastings et al., 2009),  are deletions or duplications that can vary in size from 50 base pairs (Arlt et al., 2012; Arlt et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013) up into the megabase pair range (Arlt et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2015; Arlt et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). CNV regions are especially enriched in large genes and large active transcription units (Wilson et al., 2015), and are of particular concern when they cause deletions in tumour suppressor genes or duplications in oncogenes (Liu et al., 2013; Curtis et al., 2012). There are two types of CNVs: recurrent and non-recurrent. Recurrent CNVs are thought to be produced through a recombination process during meiosis known as non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) (Arlt et al., 2012; Hastings et al., 2009). These recurrent CNVs, also called germline CNVs, could be inherited and are thus common across different individuals (Shlien et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2013). Non-recurrent CNVs are believed to be produced in mitotic cells during the process of replication. Although the mechanism is not well studied, it has been suggested that stress during replication, in particular stalling replication forks, prompt microhomology-mediated mechanisms to overcome the replication stall, which often results in duplications or deletions. Two models that have been proposed to explain this mechanism include the Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS) model, and the Microhomology-Mediated Break-Induced Replication (MMBIR) model (Arlt et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2007; Hastings et al., 2009).

 

CAs can be classified according to whether the chromosome or chromatid is affected by the aberration. Chromosome-type aberrations (CSAs) include chromosome-type breaks, ring chromosomes, marker chromosomes, and dicentric chromosomes; chromatid-type aberrations (CTAs) refer to chromatid breaks and chromatid exchanges (Bonassi et al., 2008; Hagmar et al., 2004). When cells are blocked at the cytokinesis step, When cells are blocked at the cytokinesis step, micronuclei (MN; small nucleus-like structures that contain a chromosome or a piece of a chromosome that was lost during mitosis) can appear in the cytoplasm of binucleated cells. These micronuclei are an indication of CAs and are often related to dicentric chromosomes. Dicentric chromosomes can also cause nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs; physical connections that exist between the two nuclei) (El-Zein et al., 2014). Other CAs can be assessed by examining the DNA sequence, as is the case when detecting copy number variants (CNVs) (Liu et al., 2013).

In rodents and humans, the male AGD is approximately twice the length as the female AGD (Salazar-Martinez et al, 2004; Schwartz et al, 2019). This sexual dimorphisms is a consequence of sex hormone-dependent development of secondary sexual characteristics (Schwartz et al, 2019). In males, it is believed that androgens (primarily DHT) activate AR-positive cells in non-myotic cells in the fetal perineum region to initiate differentiation of the perineal levator ani and bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle complex (Ipulan et al, 2014). This AR-dependent process occurs within a critical window of development, around gestational days 15-18 in rats (MacLeod et al, 2010). In females, the absence of DHT prevents this masculinization effect from occurring.

The involvement of androgens in masculinization of the male fetus, including the perineum, has been known for a very long time (Jost, 1953), and AGD has historically been used to, for instance, sex newborn kittens. It is now well established that the AGD in newborns is a proxy readout for the intrauterine sex hormone milieu the fetus was developing. Too low androgen levels in XY fetuses makes the male AGD shorter, whereas excess (ectopic) androgen levels in XX fetuses makes the female AGD longer, in humans and rodents (Schwartz et al, 2019)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1786","Nipple retention (NR), increased","KE 1786","In common laboratory strains of rats and mice, females typically have 6 (rats) or 5 (mice) pairs of nipples along the bilateral milk lines. In contrast, male rats and mice do not have nipples. This is unlike e.g., humans where both sexes have 2 nipples (Schwartz et al., 2021).

In laboratory rats, high levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induce regression of the nipples in males (Imperato-McGinley &amp; Gautier, 1986; Kratochwil, 1977; Kratochwil &amp; Schwartz, 1976). Females, in the absence of this DHT surge, retain their nipples. This relationship has also been shown in numerous rat studies with perinatal exposure to anti-androgenic chemicals (Schwartz et al., 2021). Hence, if juvenile male rats and mice possess nipples, it is considered a sign of perturbed androgen action early in life.

This KE was first published by Pedersen et al (2022)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1788","Status epilepticus","KE 1788","Focal seizures occur when a small group of neurons start synchronized neural signaling (See KE Occurrence, Focal Seizure). Once started, focal seizures can spread to the entire brain through various axonal pathways. GABA-ergic interneurons help inhibit seizure spread from the seizure focus forming an inhibitory region. If the activity in the focus is intense enough that inhibitory region breaks down and the seizure spreads (Kandel et al., 2013). Once the epileptiform activity has expanded to other areas in the brain, i.e., once both hemispheres of the brain are involved for approximately 5 minutes, the focal seizure has been secondarily generalized (status epilepticus) (Lowenstein and Alldredge, 1998).

Acetylcholinesterase inhibition induced seizure

In the case of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, status epilepticus has been seen to be regulated through NMDAR activation and increasing intracellular Ca2+, which is distinct from the initial focal seizure through mAChRs (Acon-Chen et al., 2016).  Anticholinergic drugs (atropine, 2-PAM&hellip;) are ineffective if administrated after seizure generalization, whereas NMDAR antagonists (memantine, MK-801&hellip;) can still be effective 35 minutes after exposure (Lallement et al., 1999; McDonough and Shih, 1997)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1790","Increased, Differentiation to Testis","KE 1790","Prior to gonadal sex determination in vertebrates, the developing organism has a primordial bipotential gonad that can be fated to either sex depending on the genetic makeup of the embryo (genetic sex determination) or environmental conditions (environmental sex determination) or a combination of both factors.

During male development, the embryonic stem cells can differentiate to primordial germ cells, which in turn proliferate and differentiate into precursor spermatogonia stem cells. Sertoli cells are the first to differentiate into the different fetal gonad seminiferous cords surrounded by peritubular myoid cells enclosing fetal germ cells. Sertoli cells can also differentiate into Leydig cells. Successively, the interstitial Leydig cells differentiate and produce sex steroids such as testosterone to maintain the testis and control aspects of masculinization including secondary sex characteristics (McLaren 1998; DeFalco and Capel 2009; Trukina et al. 2013).  

Although the timing and location of gene expression leading to the morphological development of the testis may differ among vertebrate taxa, the basic molecular machinery and pathways involved are well conserved (Cutting et al. 2013). Similarly, the cell types and basic morphological structure of the testis across vertebrates are well-conserved (McLaren 1998; DeFalco and Capel 2009)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/185","Increase, Mutations","KE 185","A mutation is a change in DNA sequence. Mutations can thus alter the coding sequence of genes, potentially leading to malformed or truncated proteins. Mutations can also occur in promoter regions, splice junctions, non-coding RNA, DNA segments, and other functional locations in the genome. These mutations can lead to various downstream consequences, including alterations in gene expression. There are several different types of mutations including missense, nonsense, insertion, deletion, duplication, and frameshift mutations, all of which can impact the genome and its expression in unique ways. 

Missense mutations are the substitution of one base in the codon with another. This change is significant because the three bases in a codon code for a specific amino acid and the new combination may signal for a different amino acid to be formed. Nonsense mutations also result from changes to the codon bases, but in this case, they cause the generation of a stop codon in the DNA strand where there previously was not one. This stop codon takes the place of a normal coding triplet, preventing its translation into an amino acid. This will cause the translation of the strand to prematurely stop. Both missense and nonsense mutations can result from substitutions, insertions, or deletions of bases (Chakarov et al. 2014).  

Insertion and deletion mutations are the addition and removal of bases from the strand, respectively. These often accompany a frameshift mutation, as the alteration in the number of bases in the strand causes the frame of the base reader to shift by the added or reduced number, altering the amino acids that are produced if that number is not devisable by three. Codons come in specific orders, sectioned into groups of three. When the boundaries of which three bases are included in one group are changed, this can change the whole transcriptional output of the strand (Chakaroy et al. 2014). 

Mutations can be propagated to daughter cells upon cellular replication. Mutations in stem cells (versus terminally differentiated non-replicating cells) are the most concerning, as these will persist in the organism. The consequence of the mutation, and thus the fate of the cell, depends on the location (e.g., coding versus non-coding) and the type (e.g., nonsense versus silent) of mutation.

Mutations can occur in somatic cells or germ cells (sperm or egg)."

General role in the biology: The sustentacular cells provide mechanical strength to the olfactory epithelium, generate the olfactory binding protein, and support the other cells with nutrients (Choi and Goldstein, 2018). Sustentacular cells are responsible for the maintenance of the ion and water balance within the olfactory epithelium (Suzuki et al., 2000). Sustentacular cells provide support to olfactory sensory neurons by maintaining ion balance (Vogalis, 2005).

Sustentacular cells have been proposed to be involved in peripheral processing of odorants in multiple ways: 


	appear to endocytose (clear) the odorant-binding proteins after signal transduction at the neurons&rsquo; cilia to allow the next round of odorant receptor binding, thereby increasing sensitivity (Heydel et al., 2013; Strotmann and Breer 2011).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1878","Decreased, Eye size","KE 1878","Animals show a wide variation in relative eye size (compared to body size) both within and between species. Eye size is directly related to visual ability. Eye size, and in particular the eye to body ratio, gives a lot of information about the quality of vision of the individual but also about its lifestyle. For example, eye size provides information on nocturnal and diurnal lifestyles in mammals (Kirk, 2006). Previous studies of eye design suggest a common organizing principle about how the activity pattern is reflected in the size and shape of the eyes (Hall, 2008). 

Large eyes generally have greater visual sensitivity as they have relatively large corneas and lenses, e.g. in primates (e.g (Kirk, 2006; Ross and Kirk, 2007), birds (e.g (Brooke et al., 1999; Hall, 2008), lizards (Hall, 2008), fish (e.g. (Bejarano-Escobar et al., 2010; Karvonen and Sepp&auml;l&auml;, 2008) and other species. Increasing the size of the whole eye can increase resolution or sensitivity without having to decrease the other. For example, a larger eye with a longer focal length may be more sensitive without loss of acuity, or it may be more acute without loss of sensitivity. However, a constraint for large eyes is that they must always fit inside an animal&#39;s head and are associated with increased development and maintenance costs (Caves et al., 2017). 

Microphthalmia is a congenital ocular deformation characterized by abnormally small eyes, with or without structural abnormalities (Le et al., 2012). Microphthalmia can occur as a consequence of a number of potential mechanisms, including but not limited to general developmental delay, increased cell death, reduced cell proliferation, and reduced cell differentiation within the developing eye (Stenkamp et al., 2002)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1883","Reduced size of the ovarian reserve","KE 1883","Formation of the follicle pool (follicle assembly)

During fetal life, primordial germ cells migrate to the genital ridges where they arrange into germ cell nests and proceed through to meiosis prophase I (Pepling &amp; Spradling, 2001). Assembly into individual follicles occurs via mechanisms that are not well known, but involves germ cell nest break down and a reduction in oocyte numbers via programmed cell death. Somatic pre-granulosa cells infiltrate between the oocytes, arrange around them in a single layer, and establish what is called the primordial follicles (Escobar et al, 2008; Gawriluk et al, 2011; Pepling &amp; Spradling, 2001). The primordial follicles constitute the follicle pool - a limited stock of oocytes that are available for maturation and potential fertilization determining the length of a female&rsquo;s reproductive life span (Grive &amp; Freiman, 2015). 

The timing of follicle assembly differs between mammalian species, but the processes involved seem to be relatively well conserved (Grive &amp; Freiman, 2015). In humans, follicle assembly occurs during mid-gestation whereas in mice and rats it is initiated around the time of birth and continues until approximately six days post partum. 

 

Reduced follicle pool as Key Event

An intact follicle pool is critical for female fertility. Any disruption to the formation of the final pool can have adverse consequences for reproductive capacity, leading to sub- or infertility. Loss of oocytes/follicles can occur during any of the abovementioned stages during the process of follicle assembly &ndash; oocyte nest breakdown, programmed cell death or somatic pre-granulosa cell intrusion. Follicle assembly and establishment of the functional follicle pool is also dependent on the stages occurring before this process, e.g. migration of primordial germ cells to the genital ridges, sex determination and meiosis."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1890","Decrease (loss of) fetal male germ cells","KE 1890","Male germ cell apoptosis in the fetal testis 

In the fetal testis, apoptosis of XY germ cells (pro-spermatogonia) takes place early during gonad differentiation (Coucouvanis et al, 1993; Nguyen et al, 2020; Rucker 3rd et al, 2000; Wang et al, 1998) and is required to adjust overall germ cell numbers to Sertoli cells within the testis cords (Aitken et al, 2011). Later in development, spermatogonia that have been damaged by, for instance by chemical exposures, are also eliminated by apoptosis (Aitken et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2007). Hence, the process of germ cell apoptosis in integral to reproductive development and a failure to eliminate damaged and excess spermatogonia can result in sterility (Knudson et al, 1995; Rodriguez et al, 1997).  Nonetheless, it stands to reason that abnormally high levels of apoptosis during fetal life will result in a smaller spermatogonial stem cell pool, and that this will likely result in diminished reproductive potential (Aitken et al, 2011). 

 

Fetal germ cell loss as Key Event

Although it is normal that a large number of pro-spermatogonia are eliminated by apoptosis during development, excessive loss during the prenatal period would be expected to have a direct consequence for fertility later in life. If all or the majority of pro-spermatogoia are lost, the spermatogonial stem cell pool will be either depleted and/or be of lower quality, and therefore the efficiency of spermatogenesis in the adult testis will be compromised. Hence, loss of germ cells during fetal life, in excess of what is normally &lsquo;programmed&rsquo;, would be expected to negatively impact adult fertility. It is relevant that spermatogenesis is relatively robust in rodents, compared with humans; in the latter, the number of sperm per ejaculate is only 2 &ndash; 4 fold higher than the number at which fertility is significantly reduced (Rahban &amp; Nef, 2020; Working, 1988)."

The ciliated airway epithelial cells are typically covered by more than hundred motile cilia (Bustamante-Marin and Ostrowski, 2017). On average, 150 motile cilia were counted per ciliated human epithelial cell in the study by Mao et al. (Mao et al., 2018). In an earlier report, 200 motile cilia per ciliated cell in human trachea is mentioned (Wanner et al., 1996), and, in a more recent study, a range of 100 to 600 ciliary precursors were counted in fully differentiated mouse tracheal epithelial cells correlated with increasing surface area (Nanjundappa et al., 2019). Cilia are 6&ndash;7 &micro;m long and 0.2&ndash;0.3 &micro;m in diameter (Brooks and Wallingford, 2014; Yaghi and Dolovich, 2016). Ciliated cell density and the motile cilia length and number per cell correlate with ciliary beating frequency which is routinely used as a predictor of the mucociliary clearance efficiency (King, 2006). Morphological changes of airway cilia are expected to impact multiple motile cilia functional integrity. This key event represents the decrease in the numbers or absence of motile cilia or reduction in length of motile cilia."

The zebrafish (Danio rerio), a genetically tractable vertebrate, lends itself particularly well as a model system in which to study the ear. Zebrafish do not possess outer or middle ears, but have a fairly typical vertebrate inner ear, the normal development and anatomy of which has been described in a series of atlas-type papers (Haddon and Lewis, 1996; Bang, Sewell and Malicki, 2001). Although the zebrafish ear does not contain a specialized hearing organ&mdash;there is no equivalent of the mammalian cochlea&mdash;many features are conserved with other vertebrate species (Whitfield, 2002).

Inner ear develops from an ectodermal thickening, the otic placode, visible on either side of the hindbrain from mid-somite stages. In the zebrafish, this placode cavitates to form a hollow ball of epithelium, the otic vesicle, from which all structures of the membranous labyrinth and the neurons of the statoacoustic (VIIIth) ganglion arise (Haddon and Lewis, 1996; Whitfield et al., 2002). 

The mature organ, found in all jawed vertebrates, has two functions: it serves as an auditory system, which detects sound waves, and as a vestibular system, which detects linear and angular accelerations, enabling the organism to maintain balance (Whitfield et al., 1996)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1931","Intestinal barrier, disruption","KE 1931","A proper definition (and related ontology) of the intestinal barrier and permeability would benefit the understanding of this biological event central in many diseases. However, it is generally accepted that the intestinal barrier is a multilayer system encompassing :

- a chemical barrier able to detoxify bacterial endotoxins, 

- a mucus layer providing a physical barrier against bacteria,

- an one-cell-thick epithelial layer which physical barrier function is ensured by epithelial cell integrity and by tight junction proteins (occludins, claudins and zonulins), adherence junctions and desmosomes 2,4,5 

- the cellular immune system present in the lamina propria underlying the epithelial cell layer 

- the antibacterial proteins secreted by the specialized intestinal epithelial cells or the Paneth cells.

Together with the chemical barrier of the mucosal layer and the cellular immune system, the intestinal epithelial cell layer has actually two barrier functions:1&ndash;3 


	It acts as a physical barrier against external factors (pathogens, toxins), 
	It acts as a selective barrier by regulating the absorption of essential dietary nutrients and  ions, meaning their transport from the lumen into the blood.


Intestinal permeability6 describes the movement of molecules across the intestinal barrier from the lumen to the blood (Figure 1), and as such, is the measurable feature of the intestinal barrier. 



Figure 1. Created with Biorender.com

Molecules can cross the epithelium via paracellular or transcellular route. Transcellular permeability encompass passive diffusion from the apical to the basal side (from the lumen to the blood), vesicle-mediated transcytosis and uptake mediated by a membrane receptor. Paracellular permeability is regulated by the tight junctions between adjacent cells and by the integrity of the epithelium.

Alteration or disruption of one or more layers of the intestinal barrier leads to increased intestinal permeability, also called intestinal hyperpermeability or &ldquo;leaky gut&rdquo;, enhancing the transport of pathogens, toxins (such as lipopolysaccharides), undigested nutrients and the translocation of bacteria of the gut microbiota from the intestinal lumen into the systemic circulation3."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/1971","Increased, tumor growth","KE 1971","Tumor growth refers to the increase in size of a cancer due to the uncontrolled proliferation of cells. The mechanisms have been detailed in Hanahan et al. hallmarks of cancer: 


	Initiation: Tumor growth often begins with the initiation of genetic alterations in normal cells. This can result from mutations caused by various factors such as exposure to carcinogens, genetic predisposition, or viral infections.
	Uncontrolled Cell Proliferation: One of the hallmark features of tumor growth is uncontrolled cell division. Initiating mutations in key regulatory genes, such as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, disrupt normal cell cycle control, leading to continuous and unregulated cell proliferation. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Mutations in genes like PTEN, a negative regulator of this pathway, can lead to its hyperactivation, promoting tumor growth (Janaku, Paplomatta). The MAPK is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in genes like BRAF and KRAS can activate this pathway, contributing to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development (Steelman, Guo).
	Angiogenesis: Tumors require a blood supply for sustained growth. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is induced by the tumor to ensure a nutrient and oxygen supply. Tumor cells release pro-angiogenic factors, promoting the development of a network of blood vessels within and around the tumor (Nishida).
	Metabolic Adaptations: Tumor cells often exhibit altered metabolism, characterized by increased glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect). This metabolic shift supports the high energy demands of rapidly dividing cells (Pham). 
	Tumor Microenvironment: Tumor growth involves interactions with the surrounding microenvironment, including stromal cells, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix. Tumor cells can influence their microenvironment to promote their survival and expansion. Fibroblasts transform into cancer associated fibroblasts to support tumor growth by producing growth factors and promoting angiogenesis (Asif).
	Immune Evasion: Malignant tumors can develop mechanisms to evade the immune system. This may involve downregulation of antigens, inhibitory signals to immune cells, or the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, allowing the tumor to escape immune detection and attack (Hiam).
	Invasion and Metastasis: Malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues and, in advanced stages, metastasize to distant organs. Invasion involves the penetration of tumor cells into surrounding tissues, while metastasis is the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body via the bloodstream or lymphatic system.
	Tumor Dormancy: In some cases, tumor growth may enter a state of dormancy, where the proliferation of cancer cells is temporarily halted. Dormant tumors can later resume growth, posing challenges in terms of early detection and treatment (Endo).


 

 

Detailed here are key molecular mechanisms associated with breast tumor growth (Hanahan):


	Genetic Mutations: Genetic alterations in key oncogenes (e.g., HER2, MYC, PIK3CA) promote cell proliferation whereas mutations in tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2) remove inhibitory controls on cell growth. (Knudson)
	Hormone Receptor Signaling: ER-positive breast cancers (70% of cancers) respond to estrogen stimulation, promoting cell proliferation. Endocrine therapies targeting ER signaling are effective in treating these cancers (Elikatkin).
	HER2/Neu overexpression : Amplification or overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) promotes cell growth and survival (Slamon, Elikatkin).
	PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway Activation: Mutations in the PIK3CA gene or activation of PI3K signaling pathway promotes cell survival and proliferation. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation leads to downstream signaling through AKT and mTOR, promoting cell growth and protein synthesis (Janku, Paplomata)
	MAPK pathway: This pathway is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in this pathway can also contribute to breast cancer development (Steelman).
	Cell Cycle Regulation: Dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and cyclin complexes controls the cell cycle progression. Inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor and retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway contributes to uncontrolled cell cycle progression (Witkiewicz).
	Apoptosis Evasion: Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) inhibits programmed cell death. Mutations or inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., p53) hinders apoptotic responses.
	Angiogenesis Stimulation: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors stimulate angiogenesis, ensuring a blood supply for tumor growth. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1&alpha;) activates angiogenic responses in low-oxygen conditions.
	Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT): Downregulation of adhesion molecules (e.g., E-cadherin) leads to increased cell mobility. Acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics enhances the ability of tumor cells to invade surrounding tissues (Drasin).
	Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Remodeling: Overexpression of MMPs facilitates ECM degradation, enabling tumor invasion.
	Metastasis Formation: Tumor cells invade surrounding tissues and enter blood or lymphatic vessels. Ability of tumor cells to survive in the bloodstream. Tumor cells exit circulation, invade distant tissues, and establish secondary tumors."

During the resting state, before an action potential occurs, voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels are predominantly closed. These gated channels only open once when an action potential has been triggered. They are called &lsquo;voltage-gated&rsquo; because they are open and close depending on the voltage difference across the cell membrane. VGSCs have two gates (gate m and gate h), while the potassium channel only has one (gate n). Gate m (the activation gate) is normally closed and opens when the cell membrane potential starts to get more positive (depolarizes). Gate h (the deactivation gate) is normally open, and swings shut when the cell membrane potential gets too positive. Gate n is normally closed, but slowly opens when the cell is depolarised (very positive). VGSCs exist in one of three states: Deactivated/closed (closed), activated (open) and inactivated (closed) &ndash; at rest, channels are (Figure 1) .

Modifications of the sodium channel gating have been studied using voltage and patch clamp experiments in different models (Ruigt et al., 1987). Prolongation of the sodium current is mainly due to the reduced rate of closure of a fraction of the sodium channel population and is characterized by a &lsquo;tail current&rsquo;. In neuroblastoma cell preparations, chemical stressors including deltamethrin and other type II pyrethroids, induce a slow tail current with a relatively long time constant. The rate at which sodium channels close during the pyrethroid-induced slow tail current depends not only on pyrethroid structure, but also on the duration of exposure, temperature and membrane potential (Ruigt et al., 1987; Narahashi., 2002; Soderlund., 2002).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2005","Altered neurotransmission in development","KE 2005","The arrival of the nerve impulse at the presynaptic terminal of the nerve&rsquo;s axon stimulates the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The neuron is a secretory cell and the secretory product, the neurotransmitter, is released to span the distance between neurons, the chemical synapse.

Neurotransmitters synthesized by the neuron are stored in the presynaptic element, inside the pre- synaptic vesicles. Release of neurotransmitter can be described by probabilistic principles. The probability of neurotransmitter release is very low under normal &ldquo;resting&rdquo; conditions but increases dramatically upon depolarization of the axonal nerve terminal by an action potential (AP).  AP depolarization of the presynaptic site of the axon terminal causes voltage gated Ca2+ channels to open. Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signalling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles, called pre-synaptic vesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Neurotransmitters are then released, diffuse across the space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, the synaptic cleft, and bind to their appropriate receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Signalling is then terminated by three different mechanisms: diffusion of the neurotransmitter out of the synaptic cleft, degradation of neurotransmitter by specific enzymes (e.g. acetylcholinesterase), or reuptake of the neurotransmitter by glia cells and the presynaptic neuron.

In principle different neurons excrete excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters, inducing in the postsynaptic membrane either a depolarisation or hyperpolarisation, respectively. In consequence these actions either trigger or impede the generation of a new postsynaptic depolarization. Neurons integrate the various excitatory and inhibitory signals they receive from the large number of synapses with their presynaptic network, resulting in a net signalling event in their postsynaptic targets.

Disruption of neurotransmission during development can result in permanent changes in nervous system function."

	slincR gene expression is dependent on Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) activation, with slincR induced up to ~log2FC=5 in whole-animal zebrafish exposed to the potent Ahr ligand, TCDD. This induction takes place only in the presence of a functional Ahr protein. SlincR is also induced by multiple other Ahr ligands. 
	
	
	slincR is located approximately 40,000 bp upstream and antisense of the sox9b gene locus in zebrafish. sox9b is one of the most reduced transcripts in the jaw when zebrafish are exposed to TCDD (Xiong et al., 2008), and is one of two zebrafish paralogs of sox9, a critical transcription factor that has been implicated in several processes including chondrogenesis and cardiac development, in addition to skeletal development, male gonad genesis, and cancer progression (Panda et al., 2021; Lefebvre et al., 2017).
	
	
	slincR was found to be enriched in the 5&#39;UTR of the sox9b gene, suggesting possible interactions between slincR and sox9b. A slincR morpholino experiment demonstrated that slincR is required for sox9b repression. 
	
	
	Morpholino knockdown of slincR showed slincR&#39;s ability to regulate cartilage development, and play a role in TCDD-induced hemorrhaging, both via whole-animal transcriptomics and phenotypic analyses."

Six mammalian isoforms of ceramide synthases exist (CerS1&ndash;6), which differ in their tissue distribution as well as in their specificity of the fatty acid chain length used for N-acylation (EFSA et al., 2018; Stiban et al., 2010; Tidhar and Futerman, 2013). The inhibition of CerS results in an increase of Sa, So, and, often, Sa/So ratio. Among others, two possible effects of CerS inhibition are 1) a decrease in the level of ceramides and complex sphingolipids (Riley and Merrill, 2019) and 2) an increase in the phosphorylated forms of Sa and So (Gelineau-van Waes et al., 2012)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2041","Decrease, palatal shelf outgrowth","KE 2041","For humans and other mammals, the palate serves as a barrier between the mouth and nasal cavity allowing for simultaneous breathing and eating. The palate consists of an anterior bony hard palate and a posterior muscular soft palate that closes the nasal airways for swallowing and directs airflow to help in generation of speech (Li, Lan et al. 2017). The palate is divided into primary and secondary portions. The primary palate contains the philtrum and the upper incisor region anterior to the incisive foramen while the secondary palate encompasses the remainder of the hard and soft palate (Bush and Jiang 2012).  The secondary palate arises during embryonic development as bilateral outgrowths from the maxillary processes. In mammals, these shelves grow first vertically down the tongue before elevating to a position above the dorsum of the tongue where the two shelves meet and fuse to form an intact palate (Ferguson 1988)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2068","Increase, Endothelial Dysfunction","KE 2068","The endothelium is the innermost lining of blood vessels consisting of a single layer of endothelial cells. As the layer separating blood and vessel walls, the endothelium controls the flow of molecules, fluid, and circulating blood cells between the two. However, the specific functions and even the structure of endothelial cells vary greatly depending on the organ (Ricard et al., 2021). Dysfunction to the vascular endothelium can age arteries and is the result of increased proliferation and apoptotic behaviour of cells including an increased response to endothelial constrictors. It is also represented by an imbalance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors which are produced by the endothelium. The dysfunction can encompass vasospasm, thrombosis, penetration of immune cells (i.e macrophage) and an increase in cyclooxygenase. These processes can activate the endothelium and a prolonged state of activation is problematic and is referred to as endothelial dysfunction (Sitia et al., 2010; Deanfield et al., 2005; Konukoglu &amp; Uzun, 2017; Korpela &amp; Liu, 2014). Other factors leading to endothelial dysfunction are loss in endothelial function leading to cell senescence and a low proliferative capacity of endothelial progenitor cells."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2078","Loss of drebrin","KE 2078","NMDA-induced excitotoxicity elicits the degradation of drebrin in primary hippocampal and cortical neurons. This process is triggered by calcium influx and mediated by calpains.

Drebrin is an evolutionarily conserved actin-binding protein in dendritic spines.  Overexpression of drebrin A in neurons enlarges dendritic spines and decreases spine motility, whereas down-regulation of drebrin A in neurons decreases the density and width of dendritic spines and inhibits synaptic clustering of NMDARs. 

Drebrin forms stable actin filaments and plays a pivotal role in dendritic spine morphogenesis (Hayashi and Shirao 1999; Takahashi et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2006).

During the initial stage of synaptic plasticity (either LTP or LTD), Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptors arises and it brings out drebrin exodus from dendritic spines (Sekino et al., 2006). 

Furthermore, prolonged NMDA-induced excitotoxicity induces calpain-mediated degradation of drebrin in vitro and in vivo."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2081","Increased Modified Proteins","KE 2081","Proteins are considered to be modified following any change in structural components, as well as protein levels. Modifications to proteins can occur at any one of the structural levels of proteins, primary structure (amino acid or polypeptide sequence), the secondary structure (alpha helix or beta sheet structures), or the tertiary structure (globular protein forms) (Alberts et al., 2002). Protein modifications can include post-translational modifications such as deamidation, oxidation, phosphorylation and carbonylation. Protein structure specificity can be crucial to their ability to execute their functional duties within a cell. Protein modifications can in turn affect protein-protein interactions, potentially hindering the ability to perform those functions (Dalle-Donne et al., 2006; Krisko &amp; Radman, 2019). These affected protein interactions can result in unfolding, aggregation, insolubility, and increased molecular weight (Toyoma et al., 2013; Young, 1994). This can lead to the development of various age-related diseases, such as cataracts. As an example, modification of the tertiary structure of lens crystallin proteins can cause protein aggregation, increased lens opacity, and eventually cataracts (Moreau &amp; King, 2012).  

Modified proteins also refers to changes in protein levels which can result from changes in how proteins are synthesized (through transcription and translation), modified, and regulated in cells (Krisko &amp; Radman, 2019). These processes are governed spatially and temporally by transcriptional and translational regulators as well as other signaling moieties and are tightly linked to the functional needs of cells, which can change depending on the presence of stressors or other external signaling factors (Reisz et al., 2014. Misregulation of protein expression can trigger a cascade of changes in downstream intracellular activities, which can then cause abnormal cellular dynamics. This misregulation can include abnormally high or low levels of particular proteins or even abnormalities in their breakdown (Hamada et al., 2014."

Improper reproductive organ formation occurring during development can impact proper reproductive function (see Palermo et al. 2021 for review with focus on exposure to phthalates).  Research in laboratory mammals has focused on signaling and gene expression (van den Driesche et al. 2012; Mendoza-Villarroel et al. 2014)), the levels of steroid compounds necessary for proper reproductive development (Kim et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2024), and the targeted disruption by toxicants during different periods of development (Foster and Harris 2005; Welsh et al. 2008).

An imbalance between bone resorption and formation towards higher bone abrasion contributes to bone loss (Bikle and Halloran, 1999). A decline of bone mineralization and bone density over time or a significant deviation from established reference ranges are direct indicators of bone loss (Cummings, Bates, and Black, 2002). In addition, bone loss can lead to increased risk of bone fractures as bone loss interferes with overall bone integrity and its capacity to withstand mechanical load (Cummings, Bates, and Black, 2002)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2098","Increase, Abnormal Neural Remodeling","KE 2098","(Adapted from KE: 618)

Abnormal neural remodeling is a normal process that allows for the encoding of new information and experiences, and it is essential in the functional and structural adaptation of the central nervous system (CNS) (Wang et al., 2010).  Remodeling of neural cells can be adaptive but stressors and stimuli that lead to persistent inflammation can degenerate brain cell types like neurons, dendrites, glial cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Hladik &amp; Tapio, 2016; Makale et al., 2017). Abnormal neural remodeling can encompass a broad range of processes (Marc et al., 2003).  Key processes include changes in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and myelination, which are all measurable. Neurogenesis involves the generation of new neurons from neural stem cells, primarily occurring in neurogenic niches such as the hippocampus (Hladik &amp; Tapio, 2016). Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of synapses to undergo structural and functional modifications in response to activity, facilitating learning and memory formation. This includes processes like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which enhances or weakens synaptic strength, respectively. Myelination, primarily mediated by oligodendrocytes in the CNS, involves the formation of myelin sheaths around axons, facilitating efficient signal transmission (Stadelmann et al., 2019).  

Exposure to environmental toxins or substances during critical developmental periods can negatively influence the many processes involved in abnormal neural remodeling. Prenatal exposure to neurotoxic substances, for instance, may disrupt fetal neurogenesis. Prolonged stress, hormonal imbalances, and the natural aging process can also contribute to abnormal  neural remodeling.  Studies show that the dendrites of neurons are an important structure for maintaining synaptic plasticity. Changes in dendritic spine density and structure, including decreases in dendritic branch points, length, and area, are correlated with changes in excitatory synaptic transmission strength which can impair brain function (Jandial et al., 2018; Auffret et al., 2009). Dendritic protein synthesis is also required for many types of long-term synaptic plasticity (Sutton &amp; Schuman 2006). Changes to the levels of protein synthesis can greatly affect neuronal communication. When dendritic complexity decreases, there can be a decline in neurogenesis and an increase in neurodegeneration. Neurogenesis is the creation of mature cells from neural stem cells (NSCs) which are involved in learning and memory, and decreased neurogenesis can impair the brain&rsquo;s function (Hladik &amp; Tapio, 2016). Together these events provoke changes in synaptic plasticity and propagations of action potentials, ultimately leading to the disruption of neuronal signaling (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018). Other types of changes related to abnormal neural remodeling include demyelination of neurons and white matter necrosis which have been associated with altered brain function such as decreased long-term memory formation (Makale et al., 2017; Tom&eacute; et al., 2015)."

Superoxide has important cellular signalling functions but, being highly reactive, excess generation can result in damage to mitochondrial macromolecules with consequent deleterious impact on the cell (Murphy, 2009)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2131","Conjugation, GSH","KE 2131","Glutathione, GSH (&gamma;-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine) is a tripeptide synthesized in the intracellular media in a two-step process: bond between glutamic acid and cysteine by the enzyme glutamate-cystein ligase followed by the combination of the resulting dipeptide with a glycin, which is catalyzed by glutathione-synthetase (Lushchak 2012; Hellou, Ross, and Moon 2012; Aquilano, Baldelli, and Ciriolo 2014). In the oxidative stress pathway, GSH is used as substrate by different types and isoforms of enzymes, such as glutathione-reductases (GRs), glutathione-peroxidases (GPXs) and glutathione-transferases (GSTs).
Conjugation with glutathione might happen spontaneously, but it is a reaction primarily catalyzed by GSTs (X. Li 2009). This class of enzymes conjugates the tripeptide with toxic chemicals (e.g. arene, oxides, unsaturated carbonyls, organic halides) in order to neutralize them, making them harmless to cells through a Michael addition reaction (Forman, Zhang, and Rinna 2009; Lushchak 2012; Aquilano, Baldelli, and Ciriolo 2014). In this case, the sulfhydryl group acts as a nucleophile and binds, for instance, to an amine group or to an atom such as Cl, as well as attacks electrophilic sites of xenobiotics (X. Li 2009). Conjugates generated from this reaction, overall, are less toxic or are excreted from cells, which causes GSH depletion (Forman, Zhang, and Rinna 2009)."

Biological state

The Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptor &alpha; (PPAR&alpha;) belongs to the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated receptors (PPARs; NR1C) steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of transcription factors.

Biological compartments

PPAR&alpha; is expressed in high levels in tissues that perform significant catabolism of fatty acids (FAs), such as brown adipose tissue, liver, heart, kidney, and intestine (Michalik et al. 2006). The receptor is present also in skeletal muscle, intestine, pancreas, lung, placenta and testes (Mukherjee et al. 1997), (Schultz et al. 1999).

General role in biology

PPARs are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives; they are sensors of dietary lipids and are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, immune response and peroxisome proliferation (Wahli and Desvergne 1999), (Evans, Barish, &amp; Wang, 2004). PAPR&alpha; is a also a target of hypothalamic hormone signalling and was found to play a role in embryonic development (Yessoufou and Wahli 2010).

Fibrates, activators of PPAR&alpha;, are commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and other dyslipidemic states as they have been shown to decrease circulating lipid levels (Lefebvre et al. 2006)."

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/244","Alkylation, Protein","KE 244","Alkylation is the transfer of an alkyl group from one molecule to another. The alkyl group may be transferred as an alkyl carbocation, a free radical, a carbanion or a carbene (or their equivalents). Protein alkylation is the addition of an alkyl group to a protein amino acid. An alkyl group is any group derived from an alkane by removal of one hydrogen atom.
Alkylating agents are highly reactive chemicals that introduce alkyl groups into biologically active molecules and thereby prevent their proper functioning. Alkylating agents are classified according to their nucleophilic or electrophilic character. Nucleophilic alkylating agents deliver the equivalent of an alkyl anion (carbanion). These compounds typically can add to an electron-deficient carbon atom such as at a carbonyl group. Electrophilic alkylating agents deliver the equivalent of an alkyl cation. Alkyl halides can also react directly with amines to form C-N bonds; the same holds true for other nucleophiles such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, thiols, etc. Alkylation with only one carbon is termed methylation. [1]  [2]
Covalent protein alkylation by reactive electrophiles was identified as a key triggering event in chemical toxicity over 40 years ago and these reactions remain a major cause of chemical-induced toxicity. Interestingly, some chemical molecules produce significant protein covalent binding without causing toxicity, which suggests that only a critical subset of protein alkylation events contributes to injury. 
The  study  by Codreanu et al. (2014) describes an inventory of electrophile- mediated protein damage in intact cells and suggests that non-toxic covalent binding may largely be survivable damage to cytoskeletal components, whereas toxic covalent binding produces lethal injury by targeting protein synthesis and catabolism and possibly mitochondrial electron transport.

However, excess accumulation leads to Fatty Liver Cells and steatosis.


In this key event we focus on excessive accumulation of triglycerides in mammalian systems.  Four major pathways for triglyceride accumulation are: 1. Increased fatty acid uptake; 2. Increased De Novo FA and Lipid Synthesis; 3. Decreased FA Oxidation; 4. Decreased Lipid Efflux (Angrish et al. 2016).  Chemical stressors can increase gene expression of key genes involving these pathways, leading to increased accumulation of triglycerides (Aguayo-Orozco et al. 2018).  In addition, excessive dietary compounds of fatty compounds can also increase likelihood of accumulation of triglycerides (Nguyen et al. 2008).  Nuclear receptors that have been implicated in causing excessive accumulation of triglycerides leading to steatosis, when overexpressed, include (Mellor et al. 2016): Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), Oestrogen receptor (ER), Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), Glucocorticoid receptor (GXR), Liver X receptor (LXR), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), Pregnane X receptor (PXR), and Retinoic acid receptor (RAR or RXR)."

Once critical size is achieved, concentrations in the plasma and temperature are thought to impose the primary limits on uptake (Tyler and Sumpter 1996). Uptake of vitellogenin into oocytes causes considerable oocyte growth during vitellogenesis, accounting for up to 95% of the final egg size in many fish (Tyler and Sumpter 1996).

These mutations may have many eventual consequences including embryonic or fetal death, or genetic disease in the offspring. If mutations are viable, the specific sites and sequence changes of the mutations will govern the phenotypic outcome of the inherited mutation.
DETAILS: Evolutionarily advantageous or beneficial mutations are expected to be rare. Thus, the majority of inherited mutations will be neutral, with a somewhat smaller proportion expected to be harmful.  For example, Keightley (2012) used phylogenetic analysis to estimate that approximately 70 new mutations occur per generation, 2.2 of which, on average, are deleterious. These deleterious mutations affect the fitness of the organism (decreasing probability of reproducing) and thus impact the population. Alternatively, one must also consider pathogenic mutations, including those that do not affect fitness (e.g., diseases that may occur later in life and do not affect ability to reproduce). It is currently not possible to fully measure the consequences of pathogenic mutations, because we lack appropriate methods to measure their penetrance (e.g., mutations with low odds ratios, diverse phenotypes, or that contribute to multigenic disorders, etc.). Thus, we currently do not have precise mechanisms to evaluate the full impacts of de novo mutations. However, increasing use of whole genome sequencing is shedding light on the rate, spectrum, and consequences of de novo mutations. Evidence is accumulating on the major role of de novo mutations in rare Mendelian and genetically heterogeneous diseases (e.g., reviewed in Veltman and Brunner, 2012; Geschwind and Flint, 2015; Walsch et al. 2010). The rate and spectrum of human mutations is reviewed in Campbell and Eichler (2013), and potential consequences of mutations explored in Shendure and Akey (2015). Estimates indicate approximately 100 loss-of-function variants in a human genome, with as many as 20 exhibiting complete loss of gene function (McLaughlin et al. 2010). As an example, based on full genome sequencing data, paternal de novo sequence mutations are expected to account for an equal amount of the genetic burden of disease in ageing fathers as maternal aneuploidies due to ageing (Hurles, 2012). It is important to note that although mutations in coding regions are expected to have large effects on fitness, the absolute number of mutations in non-coding sequence that is under selection is actually greater than coding sequence (Green and Ewing, 2013). In general, it is widely accepted that de novo mutations contribute to the overall population genetic disease burden. The application of whole genome sequencing in the clinic is providing new knowledge on the unprecedented extent to which de novo mutations are contributing to a whole host of idiopathic human genetic disorders (e.g., Lupski et al., 2011; Ku et al., 2013; Gilissen et al., 2014)."

If N is the size of the population and t is time, then the population growth rate (dN/dt) is proportional to the instantaneous rate of increase, r, which measures the per capita rate of population increase over a short time interval. Therefore, r, is a difference between the instantaneous birth rate (number of births per individual per unit of time; b) and the instantaneous death rate (number of deaths per individual per unit of time; d) [Equation 1]. Because  r is an instantaneous rate, its units can be changed via division.  For example, as there are 24 hours in a day, an r of 24 individuals/(individual x day) is equal to an r of 1 individual/(individual/hour) (Caswell 2001, Vandermeer and Goldberg 2003, Gotelli 2008, Murray and Sandercock 2020). 

Equation 1:  r = b - d

This key event refers to scenarios where r &lt; 0 (instantaneous death rate exceeds instantaneous birth rate).

Examining r in the context of population growth rate:

● A population will decrease to extinction when the instantaneous death rate exceeds the instantaneous birth rate (r &lt; 0).  

           ● The smaller the value of r below 1, the faster the population will decrease to zero.  

● A population will increase when resources are available and the instantaneous birth rate exceeds the instantaneous death rate (r &gt; 0)

           ● The larger the value that r exceeds 1, the faster the population can increase over time      

● A population will neither increase or decrease when the population growth rate equals 0 (either due to N = 0, or if the per capita birth and death rates are exactly balanced).  For example, the per capita birth and death rates could become exactly balanced due to density dependence and/or to the effect of a stressor that reduces survival and/or reproduction (Caswell 2001, Vandermeer and Goldberg 2003, Gotelli 2008, Murray and Sandercock 2020).     

Effects incurred on a population from a chemical or non-chemical stressor could have an impact directly upon birth rate (reproduction) and/or death rate (survival), thereby causing a decline in population growth rate.  

● Example of direct effect on r:  Exposure to 17b-trenbolone reduced reproduction (i.e., reduced b) in the fathead minnow over 21 days at water concentrations ranging from 0.0015 to about 41 mg/L (Ankley et al. 2001; Miller and Ankley 2004).             

Alternatively, a stressor could indirectly impact survival and/or reproduction.  

● Example of indirect effect on r:  Exposure of non-sexually differentiated early life stage fathead minnow to the fungicide prochloraz has been shown to produce male-biased sex ratios based on gonad differentiation, and resulted in projected change in population growth rate (decrease in reproduction due to a decrease in females and thus recruitment) using a population model. (Holbech et al., 2012; Miller et al. 2022)

Density dependence can be an important consideration:

● The effect of density dependence depends upon the quantity of resources present within a landscape.  A change in available resources could increase or decrease the effect of density dependence and therefore cause a change in population growth rate via indirectly impacting survival and/or reproduction.  

● This concept could be thought of in terms of community level interactions whereby one species is not impacted but a competitor species is impacted by a chemical stressor resulting in a greater availability of resources for the unimpacted species.  In this scenario, the impacted species would experience a decline in population growth rate. The unimpacted species would experience an increase in population growth rate (due to a smaller density dependent effect upon population growth rate for that species).       

Closed versus open systems:

● The above discussion relates to closed systems (there is no movement of individuals between population sites) and thus a declining population growth rate cannot be augmented by immigration.  

● When individuals depart (emigrate out of a population) the loss will diminish population growth rate.  

Population growth rate applies to all organisms, both sexes, and all life stages."

The above chapters belong to the AOP entitled: Chronic binding of antagonist to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities since the general characteristic of the NMDA receptor biology is the same for both AOPs.

Additional text, specific for this AOP:

At resting membrane potentials, NMDA receptors are inactive. Depending on the specific impulse train received, the NMDA receptor activation triggers long term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Luscher and Malenka, 2012). LTP (the opposing process to LTD) is the long-lasting increase of synaptic strength. For LTP induction both pre- and postsynaptic neurons need to be active at the same time because the postsynaptic neuron must be depolarized when glutamate is released from the presynaptic bouton to fully relieve the Mg2+ block of NMDARs that prevents ion flows through it. Sustained activation of AMPA or KA receptors by, for instance, a train of impulses arriving at a pre-synaptic terminal, depolarizes the post-synaptic cell, releasing Mg2+ inhibition and thus allowing NMDA receptor activation. Unlike GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors are permeable to calcium ions as well as being permeable to other ions. Thus NMDA receptor activation leads to a calcium influx into the post-synaptic cells, a signal that is instrumental in the activation of a number of signalling cascades (Calcium-dependent processes are describe in Key Event Calcium influx, increased). Postsynaptic Ca2+ signals of different amplitudes and durations are able to induce either LPT or LTD.

Conversely to LTP, LTD is induced by repeated activation of the presynaptic neuron at low frequencies without postsynaptic activity (Luscher and Malenka, 2012). Therefore, under physiological conditions LTD is one of several processes that serves to selectively weaken specific synapses in order to make constructive use of synaptic strengthening caused by LTP. This is necessary because, if allowed to continue increasing in strength, synapses would ultimately reach a ceiling level of efficiency, which would inhibit the encoding of new information (Purves, 2008).

LTD is an activity-dependent reduction in the efficacy of neuronal synapses lasting hours or longer following a long patterned stimulus. It has also been found to occur in different types of neurons however, the most common neurotransmitter involved in LTD is L-glutamate that acts on the NMDARs, AMPAR, KARs and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). It can result from strong synaptic stimulation (as occurs e.g. in the cerebellar Purkinje cells) or from persistent weak synaptic stimulation (as in the hippocampus) resulting mainly from a decrease in postsynaptic AMPA receptor density, although a decrease in presynaptic neurotransmitter release may also play a role. Moreover, cerebellar LTD has been hypothesized to be important for motor learning and hippocampal LTD may be important for the clearing of old memory traces (Nicholls et al., 2008; Mallere et al., 2010). The main molecular mechanism underlying-LTD is the phosphorylation of AMPA glutamate receptors and their synaptic elimination (Ogasawara et al., 2008).

It is now commonly understood in the field of spine morphology that long lasting NMDAR-dependent LTD causes dendritic spine shrinkage, reduces number of synaptic AMPA receptors (Calabrese et al., 2014), possibly leading to synaptic dysfunction, contributing to decreased neuronal network function and impairment of learning and memory processes.

Additional text, specific for the AOP &ldquo;Acetylcholinesterase inhibition leading to neurodegeneration&rdquo;:

              Seizures caused by cholinesterase dependent mechanisms result in an excess of glutamate release  that activates the NMDA receptors.  As a result, intracellular Ca2+ levels at the postsynaptic neuron can overload the calcium-control mechanisms, activating without control all the calcium-dependent enzymes (proteases, lipases&hellip;) (Deshpande et al., 2014; Garcia-Reyero et al., 2016). In cases of strong acetylcholinesterase inhibition of the CNS, the NMDAR overactivation initiated by cholinergic mechanisms can result, after the initial seizure activity (focal seizure), in the development of status epilepticus. This key event separates the initial toxicity, driven by cholinergic activity, from the secondary toxicity, which is cholinergic independent  (McDonough and Shih, 1997)."

The text specific for the AOP &quot;ionotropic glutamatergic receptors and cognition&rdquo; and &ldquo;Acetylcholinesterase inhibition leading to neurodegeneration&rdquo;:

It is now well accepted that modest activation of NMDARs leading to modest increases in postsynaptic calcium are optimal for triggering LTD (Lledo et al. 1998; Bloodgood and Sabatin, 2007; Bloodgood et al. 2009), whereas much stronger activation of NMDARs leading to much larger increases in postsynaptic calcium are required to trigger LTP (Luscher and Malenka, 2012; Malenka 1994). Indeed, high-frequency stimulation causes a strong temporal summation of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), and depolarization of the postsynaptic cell is sufficient to relieve the Mg2+ block of the NMDAR and allow a large amount of calcium to enter into the postsynaptic cells. Therefore, intra-cellular calcium is measured as a readout for evaluation NMDAR stimulation."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/39","Increased Cholinergic Signaling","KE 39","Overview


	
	Cholinergic signalling refers to the activation of receptors bound with acetylcholine. Receptors for acetylcholine are collectively referred to as either acetylcholine or cholinergic receptors. They break down into 2 different classes, muscarinic and nicotinic. Each receptor type is associated with specific downstream effects. The lists below are manifestations of associated with each receptor class.

	
		
		Muscarinic: increased salivation, lacrimation, perspiration, miosis, blurred vision, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, increased bronchial secretion, bronchoconstriction, urinary frequency, bradycardia, hypotension (Costa)
		
		
		Nicotinic: tachycardia, transient hypertension, muscle fasciculations, twitching, cramps, generalized weakness, flaccid paralysis (Costa)
		
	
	


 

Signal Transduction


	
	The signal transmission mechanisms of both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors has been intensively studied.

	
		
		The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) is associated with triggering excitatory responses in motor neurons and skeletal muscle cells (Lodish, 2000). Overstimulation of the diaphragm via nicotinic receptors can lead to respiratory arrest (De Candole, 1953).

		
			
			The nAchR has been extensively studied in neuromuscular junctions. It is a ligand-gated cation channel that allows passage of both potassium and sodium ions. Opening of nAchR ligand-gated ion channels produces a net depolarization at the muscle cell membrane, which leads to release of intracellular calcium, which triggers muscle contraction (Lodish, 2000). In this manner, acetylcholine accumulation can lead to paralysis via overstimulation of nicotinic receptors.  
			
		
		
		
		Muscarinic receptors can transmit inhibitory signals. They are expressed on pre- and postsynaptic neurons, and on non-neuronal tissues throughout the body (Lodish, 2000).
		
		
		Muscarinic receptors in the peripheral nervous system are activated by parasympathetic nerves present in airway smooth muscle, submucosal glands, and blood vessels where they trigger bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and vasodilatation, respectively (Coulson, 2003). 

		
			
			All muscarinic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors, but the specific features depends on the subtype.
			
		
		
	
	


Neuromodulator Role


	
	In addition to breaking down acetylcholine&rsquo;s effects in terms of the receptor types, researchers have started to look at acetylcholine&rsquo;s effects in terms of acting as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator. Classical neurotransmitters act on a time scale of one millisecond to tens of milliseconds. Some researchers have proposed that acetylcholine also acts as a neuromodulator that influences synaptic transmission, plasticity and coordinated firing of groups of neurons over time scales that are much longer than the millisecond time frames associated with neurotransmitters (Picciotto, 2012, Luchicchi, 2014)."

&quot;Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors belong to the
cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, responsible for
rapid neurotransmission (Karlin, 2002). In insects nAChR have signaling
roles in nervous systems and neuromuscular junctions and other cells

the endogenous neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), attaches to the
ligand binding domains on the extracellular region of the pentameric

and efflux of calcium (Ca2+) and extracellular sodium and intracellular
potassiumions, respectively, to create the action potential necessary for
synaptic signaling (Jones and Sattelle, 2010). Activation of the nAChR,
by natural or synthetic agonists, and subsequent involvement in neurotransmission
is well established. Although the nAChR is conserved
across vertebrates and invertebrates, the diverse composition and assembly

Science of the Total Environment 584-585, 751-775:

&quot;As eusocial insects, honey bees rely on theworker bee caste to forage
for nectar, pollen, andwater. Foraged water can be used for evaporative
cooling of the hive during warm weather (as reviewed by Jones and
Oldroyd, 2006). Nectar and pollen collected by the foragers are the
sole food source for the colony, with nectar providing carbohydrates
and pollen providing lipids, protein, vitamins, and essential minerals
(Brodschneider and Crailsheim, 2010). Upon returning to the hive, forager
bees identify non-foraging, food-storing hive bees and deliver their
collection by regurgitating nectar carried back in their honey stomach
(i.e., foregut of proventriculus; Free, 1959). The hive bees place the nectar
in wax cells for processing into honey. Hive bees also aid foragers in
unloading pollen from the pollen baskets (corbicula) on the forager&#39;s
hind legs and place it in cells where it is mixed with nectar to form
bee bread, which is stored for consumption by the colony (Winston,
1987). Foragers consume only small amounts of the food they collect.
Hive bees consume the food they receive in order to produce proteinrich
royal jelly and brood food, which they use to nourish both the
queen and the developing brood (Winston, 1987). During winter, the
colony survives on the pollen and nectar that was stored as bee bread
and honey over the spring, summer, and fall seasons (Seeley and
Visscher, 1985).
The act of foraging is a perilous and metabolically challenging task
that is typically carried out by worker bees in the later stages of life
(Woyciechowski and Moroń, 2009). However, the timing of the role
change from hive bee to forager can vary depending on the needs of
the colony. There are environmental, hormonal, and social cues that determine
when and how often foragers search for food and fluid, includingweather,
abundance or scarcity of food resources, magnitude of food
stockpiled in the hive, health of the colony, and size of the brood
(Dreller and Tarpy, 2000). Such cues initiate physiological changes involved
in the transition of a worker bee to foraging, which include
changes to flight muscles andmetabolic rate. These changes accommodate
the reported 70-fold increase in oxygen consumption needed to
sustain physical and cognitive activities of the forager bee (Kammer
and Heinrich, 1978). It has been documented that the volume of
neuropil in mushroom bodies is increased by approximately 15%, and
the somata of the Kenyon cells decreased by approximately 29% in foragers
compared to day-old bees (Withers et al., 1995). Change in lipid
stores also occurs in forager bees prior to foraging, whereby their abdominal
lipid is reduced to approximately half that of nurse bees
(Chang et al., 2015; Toth and Robinson, 2005). Further, there is lowprotein
content in the forager&#39;s fat body cells, and vitellogenin (Vtg; egg

yolk) protein production is significantly reduced, while juvenile hormone
levels are significantly increased (Toth and Robinson, 2005). Another
change which occurs at the stage where worker bees become
foragers is that their flight muscle fiber thickness decreases and diameter
of the myofibrils, which contain the contractile filaments, increases
in preparation for prolonged flight during foraging (Correa-Fernandez
and Cruz-Landim, 2010).&quot;"

&quot;Colony death/failure is defined as demise of a functional colony. Dramatic losses in the number of managed honey bee colonies have been reported across the globe (Potts et al., 2010) and efforts have been undertaken to survey and identify trends in losses over time, particularly in the US and European Union.

As described in Bromfield et al. (2006), seizure propagation, the process by which a partial seizure spreads within the brain, occurs when there is sufficient activation to recruit surrounding neurons. This leads to a loss of surround inhibition and spread of seizure activity into contiguous areas via local cortical connections, and to more distant areas via long association pathways such as the corpus callosum. The propagation of bursting activity is normally prevented by intact hyperpolarization and a region of surrounding inhibition created by inhibitory neurons. With sufficient activation there is a recruitment of surrounding neurons via a number of mechanisms. Of equal interest, but less well understood, is the process by which seizures typically end, usually after seconds or minutes, and what underlies the failure of this spontaneous seizure termination in the life-threatening condition known as status epilepticus (Bromfield et al. 2006)."

In most cases, the aneuploid condition will result in the death of the conceptus at different stages of embryo-fetal development depending on the chromosome involved in the aneuploidy. In humans, most

aneuploid embryos survive until the blastocyst stage and are lost around the time of implantation [Fragouli et al., 2013]; however, a decline in the rate of aneuploidy is already observed between early cleavage stage and the blastocyst stage [Fragouli et al., 2014]. When aneuploid fetuses survive to birth, they will originate offspring affected by aneuploid syndromes, characterized by variable symptoms depending on the specific chromosome involved.

 

The health consequences of a trisomic condition are well established in both humans and mice. Each of the 19 autosomal trisomies of the mouse has been produced and the survival and phenotype of each trisomy characterized [Epstein, 1988]. Growth retardation is almost invariably present and congenital malformations are frequently detected. Trisomic fetuses generally survive until at least mid-gestation. However, with the exception of trisomy 19 and to a lesser extent trisomy 16 and 18, all die prior to parturition. The precise cause of death of the trisomic embryos is not known. In some instances, it appears to be related to extremely poor embryonic growth and development. Aneuploid mouse zygotes are karyotypically unstable during preimplantation development leading to a state of chaotic mosaic aneuploidy within the blastocyst [Lightfoot et al., 2006]. In contrast to the survival of trisomic embryos and fetuses until at least mid-gestation, mouse autosomal monosomies are lethal in the pre- or peri-implantation period, with only rare survivors until day 6 of gestation [Magnuson et al., 1985]. Due to dosage compensation mechanisms, aneuploidies of the sex chromosomes in the mouse are viable [Russell, 1976].

Survival data of aneuploidies in humans generally match those in mice: aneuploidies of the sex chromosomes are viable, all autosomal monosomies and most trisomies die before birth, with the exception of trisomy 13, 18 and 21 that, in some cases, survive until shortly after birth or much longer (as in the case of Down syndrome). Even in the case of trisomy 21, the most viable of the human trisomies, an estimated 80% or more fetuses die in utero [Hecht and Hecht, 1987]. Aneuploid conditions compatible with life present a range of adverse health effects from infertility (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome due to XXY karyotype) to severe mental and physical impairment and reduced life span (e.g., Edwards Syndrome due to trisomy 18)."

First, acetyl-CoA is converted to HMG-CoA via HMG-CoA synthase. Next, HMG-CoA is converted to mevalonate via HMG-CoA reductase. Several other steps follow, but conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis (Cerqueira et al. 2016; Risley 2002). Consequently, Statin drugs inhibit HMG-CoA reductase to reduce cholesterol (Pahan 2006).

Cholesterol synthesis may also occur to a limited extent in steroidogenic cells where it&rsquo;s used to produce steroid hormones (Azhar et al., 2007)

Once cholesterol is produced in the liver, it&rsquo;s transported in the plasma. Hydrophobic lipids like cholesterol, cholesteryl ester (a cholesterol molecule bound to a fatty acid), and triglycerides are transported via lipoprotein complexes. There are different groups of lipoproteins which use different proteins and ratios of lipids including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density (LDL), and very low-density (VLDL).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/860","Decreased, Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Beta Oxidation","KE 860","PPAR&alpha; acts as a positive transcriptional regulator for many of the genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation as well as genes involved in the pre- and post-processing of fatty acids in peroxisomal pathways (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014).  Thus, decreased PPAR&alpha; nuclear signaling results in decreased transcriptional expression of genes that are regulated by PPAR&alpha;, and subsequently, decreased expression of the coded proteins and enzymes that ultimately decrease fatty acid metabolism within the mitochondria.

Genes Involved:  As reviewed in Kersten (2014), the genes (and associated functions) regulated by PPAR&alpha; in the mitochondrial processing of fatty acids include the following:  (1) Import of acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria is facilitated by PPARalpha-induced increases in expression of carnitine palmitoyl-transferases 1a, 1b, and 1 (Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2) and acyl-carnitine translocase (Slc25a20, Brandt et al 1998; Mascaro et al 1998).  (2) The first step of mitochondrial beta-oxidation is catalyzed by length-specific acyl-CoA hydrogenases (Acadvl, Acadl, Acadm, Acads; Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994).  (3) The three subsequent steps in mitochondrial beta-oxidation that successively release acetyl-CoAs from the hydrocarbon chain are catalyzed by the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (Hadha and Hadhb).  These enzymes are replaced upon progressive chain shortening by Hadh and Acaa2.  (4) the final PPARalpha targets include Eci1, Eci2, Decr1, and Hsd17b10 which convert unsaturated and 2-methlylated aclyl-CoAs into intermediates of beta-oxidation (Sanderson et al 2008, Aoyama et al 1998).

Metabolism Affected: Mitochondrial processing of fatty acids involves:  (1) Import of short, medium and long chain fatty acids (&lt;C20) acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyl-transferases 1a, 1b, and 1 (Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2) and acyl-carnitine translocase (Slc25a20, Brandt et al 1998; Mascaro et al 1998, Kersten et al 2014).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/862","Not Increased, Circulating Ketone Bodies","KE 862","A fundamental process in biological systems is the production of metabolic fuel for use in meeting the energy demands of cells and, in multi-cellular organisms, supporting overall systemic energy needs.  Physiological studies of the progression of human starvation have identified that the preferred metabolic fuel is glucose in the fed state and progressing through two days of fasting, afterward ketone bodies become increasingly important for meeting energy demands (Cahill 2006, Owen et al 2005).  Substrates derived from carbohydrates, fats and protein can contribute to gluconeogenesis (Cahill 2006, Gerich et al 2001) whereas substrates derived from fatty acids are the primary contributors to ketogenesis (Desvergne and Wahli 1999).  Mobilization of fatty acids as a metabolic fuel source increase dramatically during fasting to support both gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis (Evans et al 2004).   Cahill (2006) and colleagues have demonstrated the importance of ketone body production, especially &beta;-hydroxybutyrate, for maintaining energy homeostasis during starvation.  &beta;-hydroxybutyrate serves as an alternative substrate to glucose for providing energy to the brain in the starvation state, providing ATP at higher efficiency relative to the glucose substrate (Cahill 2006).  Interference with ketogenesis, for example by PPAR&alpha; inhibition, has been demonstrated to inhibit &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production (measured in serum) during fasting events in mice (Badman et al 2007, Potthoff 2009, Sengupta et al 2010) and cause hypoketonemia (Muoio et al 2002).  The Badman et al (2007) study indicated that metabolism of fatty acid substrates (measured as liver triglycerides) that would otherwise contribute to &beta;-hydroxybutyrate production was inhibited under PPAR&alpha; knockout.   Increased concentrations of circulating ketone bodies is indicative of potential metabolic fuel deficits in fasting animals (Cahill 2006), and a lack of increase in circulating ketone bodies during fasting, especially in conjunction with elevated blood triglycerides, indicates impaired ketogenesis and potentially impaired bioenergetic potential. Although the potential therapeutic implications of increased ketone body metabolism via ketogenic diets for various disease states has been discussed (Veech 2004), no studies were found demonstrating effects on whole organism responses to impaired ketogenesis over long-term starvation events.  A potential implication of decreased ketone body production is stress on cardiac function given that energy-stressed heart tissue shifts reliance away from fatty acids toward ketone bodies (&beta;-hydroxybutyrate) to fuel production of the ATP needed to maintain the heart&rsquo;s mechanical function (Aubert et al 2016).  Related to this observation, PPAR&alpha;-knockout mice reached exhaustion sooner than wild types in an exercise challenge which corresponded with significantly decreased &beta;-hydroxybutyrate in serum indicating hypoketonemia in PPAR&alpha;-knockout mice versus wild types (Muoio et al 2002).  Overall, diminished PPAR&alpha; function, especially in combination with fasting /diminished nutrition and/or excessive exercise may contribute to impaired maintenance on systemic energy budget."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/863","Increased, Catabolism of Muscle Protein","KE 863","After two to three days of fasting in humans, dietary glucose has been long-since expended and contribution to blood glucose from glycogen metabolism is reduced to zero (Cahill 2006).  At this point, about two fifths of fatty acid metabolism in the whole body is dedicated to hepatic ketogenesis, largely in support of the energy demands of the brain, however the brain is still significantly supported by glucose derived from gluconeogenesis (Cahill 2006).  PPAR&alpha; knockout mice that were either fasted or exercised to exhaustion had diminished capacity for maintaining energetic substrates in serum (glucose and lactate) while showing diminished capacity for fatty acid oxidation (serum nonesterified fatty acids) and decreased ketogenesis resulting in hypoketonemia (decreased serum &beta;-hydroxybutyrate) relative to wild types (Muoio et al 2002).  As fatty acid stores are depleted or become unusable (as in the PPAR&alpha; knockout condition described above), gluconeogenesis from other substrates becomes increasingly important including muscle protein catabolism in situ for supporting muscle function as well as releasing glutamine (Marliss et al 1971) and alanine (Felig et al 1970A) which can be recycled to glucose by gluconeogenesis in the kidney (Goodman et al 1966, Kashiwaya et al 1994, Cahill 2006).  Renal gluconeogenesis from glutamine and alanine supports two fifths of new glucose production while the remaining three fifths is produced in liver from, (a) alanine derived from muscle and nonhepatic splanchnic bed, (b) recycled lactate and pyruvate from red blood cells and renal medulla, (c) glycerol from adipose lipolysis and (d) small amounts of &beta;-hydroxybutyrate are recycled to glucose (Cahill 2006).  Blood concentrations of alanine exert control over hepatic glucose production and thus also represent a diagnostic of alanine contribution from muscle to support gluconeogenesis (Cahill 2006, Felig et al 1970B).  In prolonged starvation events, the catabolism of muscle protein for gluconeogenesis in order to support systemic energy needs results in loss of muscle mass which contributes to loss of overall body weight.  Although it has not yet been investigated experimentally, it is plausible based on the results described above for Muoio et al (2002) that diminished PPAR&alpha; signaling capacity could exacerbate muscle wasting in long-term fasting and/or malnutrition events."

Inflammation is a crucial link that is related to many of these conditions, with the potential for the development of cirrhosis or primary liver cancer which represent the end-stage of liver pathology and are often associated with mortality: chronic hepatitis (A-E), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [1]. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) still is a major problem in drug development as its early detection is problematic, and acute liver inflammation is the most common symptom. DILI is the main cause for withdrawal of drugs from the pharmaceutical market [2].
Liver inflammation is marked by an increased influx of neutrophils, following the secretion of signaling factors such as CXC chemokines and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) from damaged cells [3]. Kupffer cells (KCs), the resident macrophages of the liver and accounting for about 15-20% of total cell numbers in a healthy liver. They are the gatekeepers in the liver, as they monitor the blood that enters this organ [4][5]. Activation of KCs by activation of toll like receptors, for example, leads to the recruitment of further inflammatory cells as well as amplified KC activation. This, in turn, activates Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [5] which can link liver inflammation to further severe outcomes such as development of fibrosis

VSMC relaxation is regulated through a number of mechanisms, including cyclic GMP-dependent hyperpolarization and relaxation via nitric oxide (NO), cAMP-dependent hyperpolarization via prostaglandins, and stimulation of potassium channels via endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors (Durand and Gutterman, 2013).

These pathways integrate signals from both external and internal stressors to coordinate protective responses, thereby enhancing the cell&#39;s ability to cope with adverse conditions. Key components of these pathways include the activation of stress-responsive transcription factors such as NF-&kappa;B, p53, and AP-1, which regulate the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. DNA double-strand breaks, for instance, initiate a cascade of events involving the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and the p53 pathway, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and repair mechanisms or apoptosis if the damage is irreparable (Kastan and Lim, 2000). Furthermore, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including ERK, JNK, and p38, are crucial for the cellular stress response and inflammatory processes (Dent et al., 2003). 

These pathways are essential in regulating cellular survival and mediating apoptosis under various physiological and pathological conditions. Persistent signaling or a pre-existing inflammatory environment can significantly influence cell fate. For instance, the cAMP-PKA pathway, which is involved in neurotransmitter signaling, impacts synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Zhang et al., 2024). The MAPK pathway, encompassing ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases, is vital for cell differentiation, proliferation, and response to stress stimuli (Arthur and Ley, 2013; Yue and Lopez, 2020). The PI3K-Akt pathway promotes cell survival and growth by inhibiting apoptotic processes and supporting metabolic functions (Manning and Cantley, 2007). The p53 pathway is a key regulator of the cellular stress response, often leading to apoptosis in the context of severe DNA damage or oxidative stress (Kruiswijk et al., 2015). 

Exposure to stressors, such as radiation, can disrupt these stress response signaling pathways or lead to persistent activation. For example, the cAMP-PKA pathway can be hindered by reduced cAMP levels and impaired PKA activity, leading to decreased CREB phosphorylation (Zhang et al., 2024). The MAPK pathway is affected by external stressors through the inhibition of ERK activation and subsequent gene expression (Kim and Choi, 2010). The PI3K-Akt pathway, which is vital for cell survival, experiences reduced PI3K activity and Akt signaling, impairing mTOR-mediated protein synthesis (Glaviano et al., 2023; Martini et al., 2014). Activation of the p53 pathway in response to DNA damage can also potentially induce cellular senescence if the damage is irreparable (Ou et al., 2018). Persistent disruptions in these pathways can lead to a wide range of pathophysiological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. 

Key Stress Response Pathways: Description and Components for Measurement 

 

A broad way to measure these pathways concurrently is through the use of omics technologies, Omics technologies (Dai and Shen. 2022) involve comprehensive, high-throughput analysis of DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites to understand cellular functions and dynamics, offering a systems-level view of biological processes. Pathway analysis can then be used to gain insights from large amounts of omics data (Palli et al. 2019). Transcriptomics RNA sequence libraries are generated, clustering analysis is done, then sequencing for gene analysis (Qin et al. 2023). Proteins have been analyzed with proteomic analysis through LC-MS/MS analysis, bioinformatic analysis, western blot, qRT-PCR analysis or molecular docking. Metabolites are mass analyzed using the Thermo Q EXACTIVE, and then the edited data matrix is imported to Metabo Analyst for analysis (Hu et al. 2022). 

Additionally, Post-translational modifications (PTMs) can also be measured using techniques such as mass spectrometry, which identifies and quantifies modifications like ubiquitination, glycosylation, and phosphorylation. Western blotting and immunoassays detect specific PTMs using antibodies tailored to particular modifications, while labeling methods can highlight modifications like acetylation and methylation. These measurements help elucidate protein function, stability, and interactions within cellular processes.  

 

AMP-PKA Pathway:  

The AMP-PKA pathway is activated by stressors which engage G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs activation leads to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase. cAMP then goes on to activate protein kinase A (PKA), which is one of the primary kinases required for several functions in the cell such as DNA repair and initiating a response to oxidative stress (Hunter, 2000; Jessulat et al., 2021; Steinberg and Hardie, 2023). This results in PKA phosphorylating various target proteins, thereby influencing gene expression, metabolism and cell survival.  

MAPK Pathway:  

MAPK pathway is triggered by a variety of stressors, including growth factors, cytokines, hormones and various cellular stressors such as oxidative stress (Kim and Choi., 2010). The pathway involves a kinase cascade starting from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or GPCRs, leading to the activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK. Activated ERK then translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression, affecting cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Morrison, 2012).  

PI3K-Akt Pathway:  

The PI3K-Akt pathway is activated by stressors through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or GPCRs. Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), recruiting and activating Akt. Akt then phosphorylates downstream targets, resulting in promotion of cell survival, growth, and metabolism while inhibiting apoptosis (Martini et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2022).  

NF-&kappa;B Pathway:  

NF- &kappa;B is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, pathogens, and stress signals. This pathway involves the activation of I&kappa;B kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates I&kappa;B, leading to its degradation and the release of NF-&kappa;B. NF-&kappa;B then translocates to the nucleus and promotes the expression of genes involved in inflammation, immune response, and cell survival (Liu et al., 2017)  

JAK-STAT Pathway:  

The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is triggered by cytokines and growth factors. Janus kinases (JAKs) are then activated, which phosphorylate and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression, impacting cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune function. This signaling pathway is involved in multiple important biological processes such as differentiation, apoptosis, cell proliferation and immune regulation (Xin et al., 2020).  

HSP (Heat Shock Protein) Pathway:  

HSP (Heat Shock Protein) pathway is induced by heat shock, oxidative stress, and other proteotoxic stresses. Stress signals lead to the activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which translocates to the nucleus and promotes the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs act as molecular chaperones, aiding in protein folding, preventing aggregation, and promoting protein degradation. These proteins can also work as danger signaling biomarkers, being secreted to the exterior of the cell in response to stress (Zininga et al., 2018)   

p53 Pathway:  

The p53 pathway is activated by DNA damage, oxidative stress, and other genotoxic stresses. DNA damage activates kinases like ATM and ATR, which phosphorylate and stabilize p53. p53 then regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Joerger and Fersht, 2016). p53 functions also expand to roles in development, metabolic regulation and stem cell biology.  

Unfolded Protein Response (UPR):  

Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is triggered by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Hetz et al., 2020). This pathway involves sensors such as IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, which detect ER stress and activate downstream signaling pathways (Ron and Walter, 2007). UPR aims to restore ER homeostasis by enhancing protein folding capacity, degrading misfolded proteins, and reducing protein synthesis (Grootjans et al., 2016)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2245","Altered Cell Differentiation Signaling","KE 2245","Cell differentiation pathways are the processes through which unspecialized cells, such as stem cells, develop into specialized cells with distinct functions (Soumelis and Liu, 2006). These pathways are tightly regulated by a complex interplay of signaling molecules and their receptors, the binding dynamics of transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications. Signaling molecules like growth factors and cytokines bind to cell surface receptors, triggering intracellular cascades that activate specific transcription factors. Transcription factors regulate dynamically during cell differentiation, they can be classified as static, dynamic, enhanced and suppressed states. These transcription factors then bind to DNA, regulating the expression of genes necessary for the specialized function of the cell. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, further ensure that the gene expression patterns are stably maintained over cell divisions (Tanabe, 2015). 

Disruptions in cell differentiation pathways can occur due to various mechanisms, including genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, and environmental factors. Mutations in genes encoding signaling molecules, receptors, or transcription factors can lead to aberrant activation or suppression of these pathways, preventing proper cell differentiation. Epigenetic alterations, such as aberrant DNA methylation or histone modification patterns, can also result in inappropriate gene expression, further hindering the differentiation process (Miller and Grant, 2013). Environmental factors, including exposure to toxins, radiation, or pathogens, can induce oxidative stress or DNA damage, leading to the activation of stress response pathways that interfere with normal differentiation. Persistent activation or inhibition of these pathways can lead to aberrant cell fate decisions (Kharrazian, 2021). These disruptions can have significant consequences, contributing to developmental disorders, cancer, and other diseases (Wu et al., 2023).  

Key Differentiation Pathways: Description and Components for Measurement 

WNT/&beta;-Catenin Pathway: 

The WNT/&beta;-Catenin pathway plays a role in regulating the differentiation of various cell types by controlling gene expression. It is crucial for embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and stem cell maintenance (Clevers et al., 2014). In particular, WNT signalling regulates bone cell homeostasis, and activation of this pathway results in increased bone mass and strength (Baron and Kneissel, 2013). The pathway is activated by WNT proteins binding to Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors, leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of &beta;-catenin (Qin et al. 2024). One key component of this pathway is WNT Ligands, secreted proteins which initiate the signaling cascade. WNT ligands are lipid modified and have a variety of roles in embryonic development (Basson, 2012). Frizzled receptors are cell surface receptors that bind to WNT ligands. &beta;-Catenin acts as the central mediator that enters the nucleus to activate target gene transcription, and TCF/LEF transcription factors bind to &beta;-catenin to regulate gene expression (Nusse and Clevers, 2017; Steinhart and Angers, 2018). 

Notch Pathway: 

The Notch pathway plays a role in cell differentiation by influencing cell fate decisions, particularly in the nervous system, blood cells, and epithelial cells (Brandstadter and Maillard. 2019). The pathway also is a key contributor in maintaining cell polarity, proliferation, apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Parambath et al., 2024) This pathway operates through direct cell-cell interactions and is activated when Notch receptors on one cell bind to Delta or Jagged ligands on an adjacent cell. This binding triggers the cleavage of the Notch receptor and releases the Notch Intracellular Domain (Basson, 2012). The NICD then translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with the transcriptional regulator RBP-J&kappa; to activate target genes. Key components of this pathway include the transmembrane Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and their ligands, Delta and Jagged, which are essential for the pathway&#39;s activation and function (Miyamoto and Weinmaster. 2009) 

Hedgehog Pathway: 

The Hedgehog pathway is essential for the differentiation and development of various tissues, including the neural tube, limbs, and skin, as well as helping to maintain stem cells in adults. Activation of this pathway begins when Hedgehog ligands bind to the Patched (PTCH) receptor. This binding alleviates PTCH&#39;s inhibition of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor, thereby activating downstream signaling (Carballo et al. 2018). A key component of the Hedgehog pathway includes the Hedgehog ligands (Sonic, Indian and Desert), which are secreted proteins that initiate the pathway (Basson, 2012). The PTCH receptor inhibits the pathway in the absence of these ligands, while the SMO receptor activates the pathway once Hedgehog binds to PTCH. GLI transcription factors then regulate target gene expression in response to the activation of the pathway (Briscoe and Therond, 2013).  

TGF-&beta;/SMAD pathway:  

The TGF-&beta;/SMAD pathway is important for the differentiation of various cell types, including mesenchymal, epithelial, and immune cells. It also plays significant roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix production (Flanders et al., 2009). Activation of this pathway occurs when TGF-&beta; ligands bind to type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD proteins. The key components of this pathway include TGF-&beta; ligands, which are transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&beta;) proteins that initiate signaling, and the type I and II receptors that propagate the signal. Upon activation, receptor-regulated SMADs (SMAD2/3) are phosphorylated and form complexes with the common-mediator SMAD (SMAD4). These complexes then regulate gene expression to mediate the pathway&#39;s effects (Derynck and Zhang, 2003). 

JAK-STAT Pathway: 

The JAK-STAT pathway mediates responses to cytokines and growth factors, thereby influencing the differentiation of immune cells, hematopoietic cells, and other cell types. Activation of this pathway begins when cytokines bind to their receptors, leading to the activation of Janus Kinases (JAKs) (Hu et al. 2023). JAKs phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), allowing them to dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Garrido-Trigo and Salas. 2019). Cytokine receptors are key components of the JAK-STAT pathway, which bind cytokines and activate JAKs. Other key components include JAKs, which are tyrosine kinases responsible for phosphorylating and activating STATs, and STATs which are transcription factors that mediate gene expression in response to cytokine signaling (Bezbradica and Medzhitov, 2009). 

Hippo Pathway:  

The Hippo pathway plays a role in controlling organ size by regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and stem cell self-renewal. It also influences the differentiation of various cell types. Activation of this pathway involves a kinase cascade that ultimately phosphorylates and inactivates the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ. Key components of the Hippo pathway include MST1/2 (Mammalian Ste20-like Kinase), which initiates the kinase cascade, and LATS1/2 (Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase), which phosphorylate and inhibit YAP/TAZ (Zhou et al. 2024). When not phosphorylated, yes-associated protein/ transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) act as transcriptional co-activators that regulate gene expression. They partner with TEAD (TEA Domain Transcription Factors) to regulate target gene expression, thereby influencing cell behaviour and fate.  

ERK/MAPK pathway: 

The ERK/MAPK pathway is essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, playing a pivotal role in the differentiation of various cell types in response to growth factors and other extracellular signals. Activation of this pathway involves a kinase cascade where MAPK/ERK is activated by MEK, which is in turn activated by RAF (Bahar et al. 2023). Key components of the ERK/MAPK pathway include RAF (Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma Kinase), which initiates the kinase cascade, and MEK (MAPK/ERK Kinase), which activates ERK through phosphorylation. ERK (Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase) then phosphorylates various target proteins, including transcription factors such as ELK1 and c-FOS, to regulate gene expression and influence cell behaviour (Arthur and Ley, 2013; Yue and L&oacute;pez, 2020)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2201","Agonism, Retinoic acid receptor","KE 2201","Biological state: Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are nuclear receptors encoded by three distinct genes Rara, Rarb and Rarg (encoding RAR&alpha;, RAR&beta;, and RAR&gamma;, respectively). RARs are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate taxa and mediate physiological processes during development and across the lifespan (reviewed in Mark et al., 2009; Duong and Rochette-Egly 2011). Functionally, RARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that require formation of heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma;, and are activated by several retinoids, including all-trans-retinoic acid and its isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid. Structurally, RARs include (1) a ligand-binding domain (LBD), (2) a DNA-binding domain (DBD) which can bind specific DNA sequences known as retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) and (3) a transcriptional activation domain (reviewed in Chambon 1996, Rastinejad 2022). In the absence of ligand, the DNA-bound RAR/RXR heterodimers are associated with corepressors, such as nuclear receptor corepressor 1 and 2 (NCoR1 and NCoR2), and constitutively repress transcription (Kurokawa et al., 1995; le Maire et al., 2010).

 

Biological compartments: The expression pattern of Rar genes during development has been studied in various species, with Rara having a widespread expression, while Rarb and Rarg show more complex, region-specific expression in both neural and non-neural tissues (reviewed in Doll&eacute; 2009). Rarg, although present in the embryo during neurulation, has not been detected at later prenatal and early postnatal stages of brain development in rodents (Ruberte et al., 1993; Zetterstr&ouml;m et al., 1999). Rara and Rarb are expressed early in the neural tube epithelium and are involved in the patterning of hindbrain rhombomere segmentation (Ruberte et al., 1991; Dup&eacute; et al., 1999a). Later on during brain development, Rara and Rarb are co-expressed in the medulla oblongata, with Rarb showing localization in the somatic and visceral motor nuclei (Ruberte et al., 1993). Rara and Rarb are also co-expressed in the developing forebrain, particularly in the corpus striatum, hippocampus and cortex (Ruberte et al., 1993; Yamagata et al., 1994). Rarb is additionally present in the olfactory tubercle, and in the choroid plexuses and meninges (Ruberte et al., 1993). 

 

General role in biology: Retinoic acid receptors function as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators of target genes involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis (Gudas and Wagner 2011; Noy 2010), and therefore play crucial roles in a multitude of biological processes, such as embryonic and fetal development, including cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS development, reproduction and immunity (reviewed in Mark et al., 2009; McCaffery and Dr&auml;ger 2000; Clagett-Dame and Knutson 2011; Damdimoupoulou 2019; Erkelens and Mebius 2017). 

RA signalling has been extensively studied for its role in early neurodevelopmental events such as patterning of hindbrain segmentation, and there is evidence from pharmacologic and genetic ablation studies also pointing toward a later role in forebrain development (Rhinn and Doll&eacute; 2012; Schneider et al., 2001; Ribes et al., 2006; Halilagic et al., 2007; Chatzi et al., 2011; Molotkova et al., 2007; LaMantia et al., 1993)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2202","Altered expression of cell cycle genes","KE 2202","The eukaryotic cell cycle is divided into phases, comprising the interphase (G1, S, and G2) and the mitotic (M) phase. Under certain conditions, cells can exit the cycle and reversibly enter a state of quiescence (the G0 phase), terminally differentiate or enter a senescent state (Kumari and Jat 2021).

During cell division, the cells can progress through the cycle if they pass three major checkpoints (in G1-to-S, G2-to-M and M-to-G1), which ensure that the resulting daughter cells are healthy. The passage through successive phases is driven by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes (Murray, 2004). Cyclins are divided into 4 groups (A-, B-, D-, and E-cyclins) and CDKs include at least 11 proteins (Murray, 2004; Hochegger et al., 2008; Malumbres, 2009). However, there are two different perspectives as to how the cyclin-Cdk complexes temporally regulate events during the cell cycle (Hochegger et al., 2008). One model asserts that the correct completion of the S and M phases is brought about through different biochemical activities of cyclin-cdk heterodimers associated with each phase. In this view, the various cyclin-CDK complexes appear in a specific temporal sequence and target different substrates to drive progression through the cell cycle (van den Heuvel and Harlow, 1993; Sherr, 1993; Pagliuca et al., 2011). On the other hand, a second model proposes that it is the progressive increase in total CDK cell activity that drives the cell cycle, rather than CDK substrate specificity. In this view, substrates in the DNA replication phase are phosphorylated at a lower total CDK activity level than substrates in the mitotic phase (Swaffer et al., 2016). Recently, Basu et al., have reconciled these two opposing perspectives into a unitary framework which proposes a quantitative view of core CDK cell cycle control with a minor qualitative element (Basu et al., 2022). Using phosphoproteomics to study in vivo CDK activity in fission yeast, the authors show that cyclin-CDK complexes are not completely specialised for either S or M phase, and that increasing the CDK activity of S phase dimers is sufficient to carry out mitosis (Basu et al., 2022)."
"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2203","Decreased proliferation of cortical neural progenitor cells","KE 2203","Cell proliferation refers to the process of increasing the total number of cells through growth and division (Homem et al., 2015). In tissues, the rate of proliferation is influenced by multiple factors such as the initial pool of progenitor cells, the number and frequency of divisions they undergo, and the proportion of daughter cells that retain the proliferative potential (Homem et al., 2015).

During brain development, the regulation of cell proliferation is important for the production of all cell types, including neurons which assemble into functional neural circuits (Ohnuma and Harris, 2003). Neurons in the brain originate from the neuroepithelial cell (NEC) population initially undergoing symmetric, self-renewing divisions at the luminal surface of the neural tube (Malatesta et al., 2008). NECs can be identified by expression of Sox2 and Nestin, or apical surface markers like Occludin and Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO-1) (G&ouml;tz and Huttner, 2005). Subsequently, NECs undergo asymmetric divisions, generating radial glial cells (RGCs), a proliferative cell population which represents the main pool of neural progenitors for all regions of the developing brain (Anthony et al., 2004; Malatesta et al., 2008).  RGCs continue to express Nestin, and additionally express glial markers such as the glutamate transporter GLAST, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and brain-lipid-binding protein (BLBP) (Anthony et al., 2004; G&ouml;tz and Huttner, 2005).

During neocortical histogenesis, RGCs divide symmetrically and asymmetrically. The majority of asymmetric divisions are neurogenic, whereby RGC division yields a new RGC and a postmitotic neuron (Noctor et al., 2004). Other asymmetric divisions generate intermediate progenitors, which can then divide symmetrically to produce two neurons (Noctor et al., 2004). Following neurogenesis, a fraction of RGCs transition to gliogenesis to give rise to glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, whereas the remaining RGCs exit the cell cycle through a terminal neurogenic division (Gao et al., 2014)."

In animals that have a sexually dimorphic position of gonads, a key developmental pathway is reproductive tissue and organ development that differs between males and females.  Improper signaling inhibits sexual differentiation of reproductive tissue resulting in abnormal reproductive organs.  Particularly focus for INSL3 has been placed on decreased INSL3 gene expression in Leydig cells and failure of male development of the cranial suspensory ligament and the gubernaculum, resulting in cryptorchidism (Nef and Parada 1999, Zimmerman et al. 1999, Kaftanovskaya  et al. 2011).  Evidence suggests that INSL3 activates the GREAT (LGR8) receptor (Bogatcheva et al. 2003).  Targeted disruption of INSL3 through toxicant exposure has been used in laboratory mammal studies to further investigate resulting effects (from phthalates see Wilson et al. 2004; Wilson et al. 2007)."

Epididymal agenesis and abnormal epididymal organ formation are indicative of improper reproductive organ formation during development (see Palermo et al. 2021 for review with focus on exposure to phthalates).  Research in laboratory mammals has focused on the levels of steroid compounds necessary for proper reproductive development (Wilson et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2010; Gray et al. 2016), and the targeted disruption by toxicants during different periods of development (Foster and Harris 2005; Welsh et al. 2008)."

Disruption of lipid storage and transport can be identified by excess accumulation of fatty acids or other lipids in the liver or altered ratios of expected lipid species which can ultimately lead to liver steatosis (Ipsen et al. 2018).  An example of an event that can cause disrupted lipid storage is the binding of stressor ligands to the PPAR isoforms with either agonist or antagonist interactions which can lead to effects on lipid storage and transport (Dixon et al. 2021).  PPAR&gamma; over expression results in promotes storage of lipids in the liver and thus exacerbates hepatic steatosis (Yu et al. 2003; Patsouris et al. 2006).  Conversely, deletion of PPAR&alpha; resulted in an increased liver lipid (Patsouris et al. 2006).  Wang et al. (2003) demonstrated that PPAR&beta;/&delta; deficient mice had increased obesity which, while potentially not a function of improper lipid storage, underpins the importance of all PPAR isoforms in proper lipid homeostasis.  Evidence of disruption of lipogenesis at the transcriptional level has also been observed across multiple studies using PFAS as the stressor (Tse et al. 2016; Cui et al. 2017; Huck et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019; Martinez 2019; Yi et al. 2019; Louisse et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2022a)."

This Key Event describes the binding of stressor ligands to the PPAR isoforms with either agonist or antagonist interactions.  Numerous studies have shown the ability of synthetic ligands to bind the ligand binding domains of the PPAR isoforms (&alpha;, &beta;/&delta;, &gamma;).  Some of these synthetic ligands can be PPAR isoform specific whereas others, like bezafibrate, can bind and activate all 3 main PPAR isoforms (Grygiel-G&oacute;rniak 2014).

"https://identifiers.org/aop.events/2227","Disrupted PPAR isoform nuclear signaling","KE 2227","This Key Event describes disruption of PPAR isoform nuclear signaling following the binding of stressor ligands to the PPAR isoforms with either agonist or antagonist interactions.  Following binding with an activating ligand, PPAR isoforms heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) with this complex then recognizing the peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) of the PPAR isoform target genes promoting gene expression (Capelli et al. 2016).  Therefore, non-native ligands that bind the PPAR isoforms either agonistically or antagonistically can disrupt proper PPAR activity and signaling of either expression or repression of target genes.  Results from activity assays, nuclear signaling assays, and transcriptomic analyses using PPAR isoform agonist and antagonist have demonstrate that PPAR ligands directly affect PPAR activity, nuclear signaling, and the transcription of PPAR mediated target genes (Kojo et al. 2003; Behr et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2020; Evans et al. 2022; Murase et al. 2023; Ardenkj&aelig;r-Skinnerup et al. 2024). Moreover, studies have demonstrated that exposure to the prototypical stressor, PFOS, can have a direct effect on the transcriptional expression of the PPAR isoforms in vertebrates (Lee et al. 2020; Beale et al. 2022) with these studies showing expression changes occurring primarily in the PPAR&alpha; and PPAR&gamma; isoforms.  

Beyond the direct effects of stressor ligands on PPAR isoforms, activation of one PPAR isoform can have effects on the expression of other PPAR isoforms.  For example, agonism of PPAR&beta;/&delta; can cause reduced expression of PPAR&alpha; and PPAR&gamma; isoforms (Shi et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2020), and certain coregulators can have effects (sometimes opposite) on different PPAR isoforms (Tahri-Joutey et al. 2021). Finally, omics studies have shown that agonist and antagonist of PPAR isoforms alter PPAR signaling transcripts (Louisse et al. 2020; Heintz et al. 2024).  Overall, this evidence displays that disruption of PPAR isoforms via stressor chemicals can affect other PPAR isoforms and impact PPAR nuclear signaling."
